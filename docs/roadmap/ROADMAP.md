# JAD — Implementation Roadmap & Feature Planning

> **Authority:** This document defines the **implementation planning SSOT** for the JA&D (JAD) system: phases, milestones, feature groups, dependencies, implementation sequence, MVP scope, exit criteria, and risks.
>
> **Planning authority and limitations:** This roadmap sequences and schedules **only** requirements and rules already approved in `../requirements/REQUIREMENTS.md` and `../business/BUSINESS-RULES.md`. It does **not** approve, modify, or invent requirements, business rules, priorities, or decisions. Items marked `TBD`, `OPEN`, or `ASSUMPTION` require Owner/Stakeholder confirmation.
>
> **Companion document:** The feature inventory is maintained in `../features/FEATURES.md`. Features are referenced here by ID.
>
> **Version:** Project 01 — Feature & Implementation Planning (Baseline v1.0)

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

The roadmap establishes the logical build order for the JAD platform from its confirmed requirements and business rules. It groups work into phases that respect hard dependencies (e.g., qualifying sale → commission → clearing → eWallet → withdrawal) and separates approved scope from owner-decision-gated scope.

### 1.2 Relationship to the SSOT

| Document | Role |
|---|---|
| `REQUIREMENTS.md` | Source of approved functional/non-functional requirements (FR/NFR IDs) |
| `BUSINESS-RULES.md` | Source of approved business rules (BR/BI/OD IDs) |
| `FEATURES.md` | Feature inventory (FEAT IDs) with acceptance criteria and status |
| `ROADMAP.md` (this) | Phases, milestones, dependencies, MVP, risks |

### 1.3 Current Verified State

- Repository contains **documentation only** (requirements, business rules, features, roadmap). **No application code exists.**
- All features are `NOT_STARTED` unless marked `BLOCKED` or `DEFERRED` in FEATURES.md.
- 25 Owner Decision Items (OD-001..025) remain open and gate specific features (FEATURES.md §6.1).

## 5. Dependencies

### 5.1 Dependency Types
| Type | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Hard** | Feature cannot start until the dependency is complete |
| **Soft** | Sequencing preferred; work can be partially parallelized |
| **External** | Depends on a third-party/infrastructure capability outside JAD |
| **Pending decision** | Depends on an Owner/CTO decision (OD item) |

### 5.2 Requirement / Business-Rule Dependencies
- Commission rules (BR-COM, BR-CLC, BR-CAN, BR-LED) depend on qualifying-sale rules (BR-SAL) — hard.
- Direct Referral (BR-COM-002) depends on single-level referral structure (BR-REF-001/002) — hard.
- Available Balance rules (BR-WAL-002/003) depend on commission lifecycle (BR-CLC-001) — hard.
- Withdrawal rules (BR-WDR) depend on available balance (BR-WAL) and payout verification (BR-PAY) — hard.
- Invariants BI-001..BI-010 must hold from the moment their governing feature ships; they are tested continuously.

### 5.3 Data Model
- Entities and relationships follow the confirmed business model (REQUIREMENTS §1.3). No payment-gateway/money-movement schema (FR-BND-003).

### 5.4 Authentication / Authorization
- Authentication (FEAT-002) precedes RBAC (FEAT-003); object-level authorization applies to all member-facing records.

### 5.5 Backend / API / Frontend
- Backend domain services are sequenced per phase; member-facing UIs ship with each phase's member capabilities. Reporting (P10) depends on ledger/referral data (P5/P3).

### 5.6 Integrations — External
| Integration | Used by | Type |
|---|---|---|
| Email service | FEAT-006 | External (provider OPEN — ASSUMPTION 2) |
| Geolocation services (GPS/IP) | FEAT-014 | External (provider OPEN — ASSUMPTION 3) |
| Push notification infrastructure | FEAT-063 | External (provider OPEN — ASSUMPTION 6) |
| CTO-authorized signing service | FEAT-059 | External (ASSUMPTION 7) |
| External payment/payout platforms | FEAT-070 | External (record-only; no money movement) |

### 5.7 Pending Decisions (Owner)
- OD-001..005 → FEAT-069 (program rules)
- OD-006..012 → FEAT-041 (Group Incentive)
- OD-013 → FEAT-022 (sponsor change)
- OD-014/015 → FEAT-017/018 (geolocation accuracy/spoofing)
- OD-016 → FEAT-047 (payout providers)
- OD-017/018 → FEAT-051 (withdrawal model)
- OD-019..023 → FEAT-058 (voucher rules)
- OD-024 → FR-REG-006 (future registration attempts)
- OD-025 → FEAT-066 (Total Earned)

### 5.8 Testing / Documentation
- Acceptance criteria (AC-* in REQUIREMENTS §12) are the phase gates; documentation must be updated per phase exit criteria.

---

## 6. Implementation Sequence

Recommended order follows the dependency chain; parallelize only within a phase:

```text
P1 Foundation
  → P2 Members & Qualification
  → P3 Referral & Sponsor
  → P4 Catalog, Customers & Sales
  → P5 Commission Engine
  → P6 eWallet & Financial Ledger
  → P7 Payouts & Withdrawals        ← M5 MVP Ready
  → P8 Vouchers & QR Security
  → P9 Marketing, Policies & Notifications
  → P10 Reporting & Genealogy
  → P11 Abroad Program & Geolocation
  → P12 Group Incentive (deferred)
```

**Sequencing rationale:**
- P2 must precede P3/P4 because Active + Qualified eligibility gates both sponsorship and sale submission.
- P4 must precede P5 because commissions are created only from Qualifying Sales.
- P5 must precede P6 because commissions populate the ledger.
- P6 must precede P7 because withdrawals draw on Available Balance.
- P8 is independent of P4–P7 but depends on P1 (RBAC, config) and the CTO signing service; it is scheduled after MVP so the core revenue path is proven first.
- P11 geolocation mechanics (FEAT-014..016) are CONFIRMED but integrated only once program separation is exercised; gated items (FEAT-017/018) wait on Owner decisions.
- P12 waits entirely on Owner decisions OD-006..012.

---

## 7. MVP Scope

### 7.1 MVP Definition
**MVP = Phases P1..P7** — the complete confirmed core business model: membership → qualification → referral → sale → commission → clearing → eWallet → payout/withdrawal.

Features in MVP: FEAT-001..013, FEAT-019..040, FEAT-042, FEAT-043, FEAT-071, FEAT-044..051, FEAT-070. (FEAT-017/018, FEAT-022, FEAT-041, FEAT-047, FEAT-051, FEAT-058, FEAT-066, FEAT-069 remain gated/deferred within or beyond this set — see §7.4.)

### 7.2 Explicitly Excluded from MVP
- Vouchers & QR redemption (P8 — FEAT-052..059).
- Marketing, policies & notifications (P9 — FEAT-060..063).
- Reporting & genealogy views (P10 — FEAT-064..067).
- Abroad program & geolocation (P11 — FEAT-014..018, FEAT-068, FEAT-069).
- Group Incentive (P12 — FEAT-041).

### 7.3 MVP Dependencies
- Hard: P1..P6 complete.
- Pending decisions that affect MVP withdrawal capability: OD-016 (payout providers) and OD-017/018 (withdrawal status model) — the minimal confirmed withdrawal flow (request → reserve → complete/reject → release) can be delivered; final model integration waits on Owner decisions.
- Pending decision OD-013 (sponsor-change circumstances) affects only the change-circumstances portion of FEAT-022; the approval+audit workflow is MVP-eligible.

### 7.4 MVP Exit Criteria
1. M5 gate: P1..P7 complete.
2. AC-REG-001, AC-REF-001, AC-SAL-001, AC-COM-001, AC-COM-002, AC-WAL-001, AC-ADJ-001, AC-WDR-001, AC-BND-001 all pass.
3. Invariants BI-001..BI-006, BI-009, BI-010 hold throughout.
4. RBAC matrix and audit requirements validated (NFR-SEC-001/002, NFR-AUTHZ-001/002).
5. No money movement, no payment gateway, no MLM, no automatic refunds (out-of-scope boundaries respected).
6. No TBD rule silently implemented; every OD-gated item either approved or explicitly excluded from the MVP build.

### 7.5 MVP Assumptions
- Domestic program is the primary MVP operating program (exact Domestic/Abroad rules are OD-gated).
- Payout method set minimal until OD-016; verified-account and withdrawal flows use the confirmed lifecycle.
- No customer self-service access (ASSUMPTION 4).

---

## 8. Future Scope

### 8.1 Approved but Beyond MVP (scheduled later)
- Vouchers & QR redemption (P8), Marketing/Policies/Notifications (P9), Reporting & Genealogy (P10), Abroad Program & Geolocation (P11), Group Incentive (P12, pending OD-006..012).

### 8.2 Future / Decision-Gated (NOT approved to implement)
These remain `TBD / REQUIRES OWNER APPROVAL` per the SSOT. Implementing them is **prohibited** until approval:
- Maximum registration attempts (OD-024 — FUTURE scope, REQUIREMENTS §3.3).
- Domestic/Abroad rule differences (OD-001..005).
- Group Incentive parameters (OD-006..012).
- Sponsor-change circumstances (OD-013).
- Geolocation accuracy threshold (OD-014) and anti-spoofing (OD-015).
- Final payout providers (OD-016).
- Final withdrawal status model/workflow (OD-017/018).
- Voucher transfer/revocation/expiration/merchant permissions (OD-019..023).
- Total Earned definition (OD-025).

---

## 9. Phase Exit Criteria (Summary)

For every phase, exit requires all of the following (as applicable):
- **Requirements satisfied:** All phase FRs/NFRs implemented and verified.
- **Business rules implemented:** Governing BRs enforced; no violations of BI invariants.
- **Functional tests passed:** Phase acceptance criteria (AC-*) pass.
- **Security/authorization validated:** RBAC matrix and object-level rules validated; audit trails captured.
- **Integration tests passed:** Cross-phase integrations (e.g., qualifying sale → commission → ledger) pass.
- **Documentation updated:** Requirements/business/features/roadmap statuses updated to reflect completion.
- **Known blockers resolved:** No unresolved `BLOCKED` features within phase scope (decision-gated features are formally excluded and tracked).

Phase-specific criteria are listed in §2.

---

## 11. Approval Boundary

The following require explicit Owner/Stakeholder approval before their implementing phase begins; they are **not** silently resolvable by the development team:

1. All OD-001..025 decisions (see §8.2 and FEATURES.md §6.1).
2. Commission rate finalization (PROVISIONAL 8%/4% — R-11).
3. CTO signing service design and availability (R-02).
4. External provider selection (email, geolocation, push, payout — R-03).
5. Architecture and infrastructure decisions (tech stack confirmed as TypeScript full-stack; deployment/infrastructure still OPEN — R-10).
6. Any change to security boundaries (CTO key control, authorization model).
7. Any destructive data implications or financial-data migration strategy.

---

## 12. Consistency Notes

- Phase/feature/status references align with FEATURES.md; acceptance criteria align with REQUIREMENTS.md §12; business-rule references align with BUSINESS-RULES.md.
- If REQUIREMENTS.md or BUSINESS-RULES.md is revised, re-verify this roadmap's phase/feature/status mappings before proceeding.
