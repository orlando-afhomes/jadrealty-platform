# JAD — Documentation Consistency Audit Report (AUDIT-REPORT.md)

> **Purpose:** Cross-document consistency audit of the JA&D (JAD) platform SSOT set performed before any frontend implementation. Verifies whether the 21-document documentation baseline is internally consistent and actionable, classifies findings, establishes the Frontend Implementation Baseline, and records the implementation readiness status.
>
> **Method:** Full read of all documents under `docs/` plus `CHANGELOG.md` (≈10,600 lines), including the ADR register (`docs/decisions/`, ADR-001..012), and verification of cross-references (precedence chains, section citations, decision IDs, endpoints, invariants).
>
> **Audit date:** 2026-08-19. **Auditor:** AI agent (opencode).
>
> **Status vocabulary:** **CONSISTENT** = documents agree · **MINOR GAP** = minor cross-reference/formatting drift · **DOCUMENTATION GAP** = content absent but required · **IMPLEMENTATION GAP** = no code/artifact exists · **CONFLICT** = direct contradiction between authoritative documents · **BLOCKER** = prevents safe implementation until resolved.
>
> **Readiness status:** **READY WITH NON-BLOCKING ISSUES** (see §13).

## 1. Executive Summary

The repository (`C:\Users\SSD-ORLANDO\Documents\Project\jad-realty`) is **documentation-only** — no Git repository, no source code, no manifests, no CI/CD, no tests. The 21-document SSOT set is **highly consistent on substance** for the responsive-web frontend MVP baseline: stack, authentication, money representation, API contract, authorization model, screen register, testing strategy, and security controls agree across every document that touches them.

Two **CONFLICT**-level findings exist, both already acknowledged in the documentation and **non-blocking for the responsive-web MVP (P1..P7)**:

- **F-1** — the documented precedence/authority chains diverge between `ARCHITECTURE.md`/`UI-UX.md` and the majority of downstream documents.
- **F-2** — the decision ID `ARCH-DEC-006` is overloaded (used for both the native-mobile approval and the CTO signing-service mechanism); recorded in `docs/decisions/README.md`.

A large, well-documented set of `REQUIRES APPROVAL` decisions gates the start of any implementation (toolchain, design-system values, testing tooling, CI, financial-path contracts). None may be silently decided by implementers.

**Readiness: READY WITH NON-BLOCKING ISSUES** — the documentation is a consistent input for frontend implementation, subject to the required approvals in §13.

---

## 2. Repository / Frontend Current State

- 22 files: `CHANGELOG.md` + 21 documentation files. ≈10,600 lines. Not a Git repository.
- No source code, `package.json`, lockfile, `.env.example`, Docker/compose, CI/CD, infrastructure, or tests.
- Implementation phases `P1..P12` are all **Not started** (`CHANGELOG.md:170-181`).
- Document versions: `Baseline v1.0` except:
  - `API-SPECIFICATION.md` = **Audited Baseline v1.1** (Project 09 — API & Integration Engineering).
  - `DATABASE-DESIGN.md` and `SECURITY.md` carry **no in-file version header** (documented, `CHANGELOG.md:100,134,192`).
- Frontend baseline documents exist and are internally consistent: `FRONTEND-ARCHITECTURE.md`, `UI-UX.md`, `DESIGN-SYSTEM.md`, `TECH-STACK.md §2`, `FOLDER-STRUCTURE.md §3`, `DEVELOPMENT-GUIDELINES.md`, plus ADR-005/006/009/010/011.

---

## 3. Documentation Authority Map

Canonical precedence chain (used by the majority — 7 documents):

```
BUSINESS-RULES → REQUIREMENTS → FEATURES → ROADMAP → ARCHITECTURE → API-SPECIFICATION → TECH-STACK → UI-UX → DESIGN-SYSTEM → FOLDER-STRUCTURE → FRONTEND/BACKEND/DATABASE → MOBILE → DEVELOPMENT-GUIDELINES
```

Sources: `CODE-REVIEW-GUIDELINES.md:5`, `MOBILE-ARCHITECTURE.md:5`, `DEPLOYMENT.md:7`, `FRONTEND-ARCHITECTURE.md:5`, `BACKEND-ARCHITECTURE.md:5`, `DEVELOPMENT-GUIDELINES.md:5`.

Companion quality SSOTs: `TESTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `INTEGRATION-SPECIFICATION.md`, `CODE-REVIEW-GUIDELINES.md` — authorities for their own domains.

Conflict-resolution rule: **never invent a resolution.** Apply the precedence chain; if the chain does not decide, mark `REQUIRES APPROVAL` and escalate (`CODE-REVIEW-GUIDELINES.md §6`; `BUSINESS-RULES.md §13`).

**Divergent chains:** `ARCHITECTURE.md:5` and `UI-UX.md:5` deviate — see **Conflict F-1**.

## 5. Conflicts

### F-1 — Precedence chain divergence (MINOR-GAP-level CONFLICT)

- **Source A:** `ARCHITECTURE.md:5` — `… → ARCHITECTURE → TECH-STACK → FOLDER-STRUCTURE → API-SPECIFICATION` (chain stops there; omits UI-UX/DESIGN-SYSTEM and downstream).
- **Source B:** `UI-UX.md:5` — `… → ARCHITECTURE → TECH-STACK → FOLDER-STRUCTURE → API-SPECIFICATION → UI-UX → DESIGN-SYSTEM` (places FOLDER-STRUCTURE *above* API-SPECIFICATION).
- **Majority:** `… → ARCHITECTURE → API-SPECIFICATION → TECH-STACK → UI-UX → DESIGN-SYSTEM → FOLDER-STRUCTURE → …` (7 documents).
- **Why it matters:** the chain decides authority when documents conflict. The disputed pairs are (API-SPECIFICATION vs FOLDER-STRUCTURE) and (API-SPECIFICATION vs TECH-STACK). Document substance does not currently conflict, so there is no implementation impact today.
- **Resolution:** update `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `UI-UX.md` header chains to the canonical chain. **REQUIRES OWNER APPROVAL** (SSOT edit).

### F-2 — `ARCH-DEC-006` is overloaded (documented; must be reconciled)

- **Usage 1 — signing-service mechanism:** `ARCHITECTURE.md:315` (§16), `BACKEND-ARCHITECTURE.md:452`, `SECURITY.md:101/323`, `DEPLOYMENT.md:56/200/216/400`, `TECH-STACK.md:264`, `ADR-007`.
- **Usage 2 — native-mobile approval:** `ARCHITECTURE.md:109` (§3.5), `MOBILE-ARCHITECTURE.md` (multiple), `TECH-STACK.md:23`, `UI-UX.md:967` (UX-DEC-004), `CODE-REVIEW-GUIDELINES.md:20`, `ADR-005`.
- **Status:** already recorded in `docs/decisions/README.md:38-39`; the ADR register preserves each source's usage and does not invent a resolution.
- **Why it matters:** two different approval-gated decisions share one ID. The native-mobile gate (P12) and the signing mechanism gate (P8) are separate Owner/CTO decisions.
- **Resolution:** Owner/CTO assigns distinct IDs (e.g., ARCH-DEC-006 → native mobile; new ID → signing mechanism) and updates all references. Non-blocking for the P1..P7 web MVP.

---

## 6. Blockers

**No hard BLOCKER on documentation consistency for the responsive-web MVP (P1..P7).** Both conflicts concern approval-gated, post-MVP/P8 items. The approval-gated decisions in §13 gate implementation *start* but are governance-by-design, not documentation inconsistencies.

---

## 7. Documentation Gaps

- No accessibility NFR exists (`UI-UX.md §12/§13.4`); accessibility standards are PROPOSED / REQUIRES APPROVAL.
- No numeric NFR targets: NFR-PERF/AVAIL/REL/SCAL-001 and RPO/RTO are TBD (`REQUIREMENTS §7`; `ARCH-DEC-009`).
- No concrete design-system values — colors/fonts/spacing/breakpoints are all TBD (`DESIGN-SYSTEM.md:9,331`); no brand assets exist.
- Credential policy (`ASSUMPTION 1`), CSRF mechanism, rate-limit values, Idempotency-Key TTL, signing mechanism, and all external providers — `REQUIRES APPROVAL`.
- OD-gated scope OD-001..025 (programs, geolocation thresholds, group incentive, Total Earned, voucher rules, payout methods).
- Missing version headers: `DATABASE-DESIGN.md`, `SECURITY.md` (`CHANGELOG.md:100,134,192`).

---

## 8. Implementation Gaps

- No code, monorepo scaffold, manifests, lockfile, `.env.example`, CI/CD, Docker/compose, infrastructure, or Git.
- Entire frontend toolchain is PROPOSED / `REQUIRES APPROVAL` (`FRONTEND-ARCHITECTURE.md:15`): React Router, TanStack Query, Zustand, React Hook Form, CSS Modules/Tailwind, Vitest/Playwright, pnpm/Turborepo, `openapi-typescript`. ADR-011/012 are **Proposed**.
- No tests, no invariants, no CI to run — all `REQUIRES VERIFICATION` until P1.

---

## 9. Security Findings

**Positive (CONSISTENT):**
- Server-only authorization; client is never the security boundary.
- HttpOnly/Secure/SameSite cookies + refresh rotation; no JWT.
- Object-level ownership + 404-hides-existence (NFR-AUTHZ-002); RBAC guards on every endpoint.
- CTO-controlled signing boundary (BI-008); app verifies only.
- Least-privilege DB roles; `UPDATE`/`DELETE` revoked on financial/audit tables (BI-005).
- Hashed session/verification/idempotency tokens; append-only same-transaction audit.
- No PII/financials/secrets in logs, error responses, or bundles; `.env*` ignored; `VITE_`-prefixed public vars only.
- Prohibited-technology list (payment/money-movement/MLM/float-money/embedded-key libraries).

**Frontend rule:** no secrets in any bundle; only `VITE_`-prefixed public variables (`DEVELOPMENT-GUIDELINES.md §18`; `SECURITY.md §7`). Business parameters are served via `GET /config/public`, never baked into env/bundles (`BR-CFG-001`).

**Approval-gated security items (no violations; all documented):** SA-01..SA-13 (`SECURITY.md §20`), including CSRF mechanism (SA-02/RA-05), rate-limit values (SA-03), Idempotency-Key TTL (SA-04), signing mechanism (SA-05), file-upload policy (SA-08), incident-response plan (SA-12).

No secrets or credentials found in any document.

---

## 10. Testing Readiness

- Strategy fully specified and consistent: risk-based (R-04 financial integrity, R-05 authorization leakage, R-07 atomicity), invariant tests BI-001..BI-010 in CI, full role × endpoint matrix at the API boundary, idempotency/concurrency tests, 5 critical E2E journeys, per-screen UI-state tests, `AC-*`/`BR-*`/`BI-*` traceability.
- Environments and data rules defined: fresh + deterministic, no production data, test-only signing keys.
- Tooling (Vitest/Supertest/Playwright) and CI provider are PROPOSED / `REQUIRES APPROVAL` (RA-01/RA-02); coverage thresholds and performance scope `REQUIRES APPROVAL` (RA-03/RA-04).

---

## 11. Frontend Implementation Baseline (from the docs — NOT approved)

- **Apps:** `apps/web` (Member, P2..P10), `apps/admin` (Admin/Finance/Super Admin), `apps/merchant` (P8 redemption) — React + Vite + TypeScript, responsive. **No React Native** (CONFIRMED).
- **State (PROPOSED):** local `useState`/`useReducer` + TanStack Query server state + minimal Zustand global. **No client-side business truth, no financial math.** Money arrives as exact-decimal strings; formatting only (`packages/shared`).
- **API layer (PROPOSED):** single typed fetch client generated from OpenAPI (`openapi-typescript`) in `lib/api`; `/api/v1`; `{ data, meta }`; error envelope; **cursor** pagination for ledger/financial streams, **page-based** for admin lists; `Idempotency-Key` on sales/withdrawals/redemptions/adjustments with key reuse on retry; `401 → login preserving destination`; `403/404/422/429` mapped to UI-UX §10 states.
- **Routing (PROPOSED):** React Router; lazy route-level code-splitting; route guards are **UX only**; session restore via `/auth/me`; session cookie, never client-held tokens.
- **Components:** 3 tiers (shared primitives / feature components / route screens); feature slices mirror FG-*; component inventory per DESIGN-SYSTEM §6 (concrete values TBD).
- **Forms (PROPOSED):** React Hook Form + Zod schemas from `packages/contracts`; UI-UX §9 (visible labels, inline errors + first-field focus, single-submit with Idempotency-Key, unsaved-changes warning, disabled-with-remedy).
- **Screens:** strictly the UI-UX §6 register (`SCR-*`); no invented screens; UI states per UI-UX §10 (incl. Pending ≠ Available, `₱0.00` empty state, partial-data indicator).
- **Design (all PROPOSED / REQUIRES APPROVAL):** breakpoints <640 / 640–1023 / ≥1024; touch targets ≥44px; WCAG-2.1 AA; tables → stacked cards on mobile; no token value approved.
- **Environment:** `VITE_`-prefixed public vars only; business params via `GET /config/public`; typed env in `packages/config`.

---

## 12. Recommended Resolution Actions

1. **Owner/CTO:** reconcile F-2 (split ARCH-DEC-006) — required before P8 (signing) and P12 (native); not required for P1..P7.
2. **Owner:** unify F-1 precedence chain in `ARCHITECTURE.md`/`UI-UX.md` headers to the canonical chain.
3. **Fix wrong cross-references (MINOR GAP):**
   - `UI-UX.md:917` (§12.8) → DESIGN-SYSTEM **§7.4** (Touch targets; not §7.3).
   - `MOBILE-ARCHITECTURE.md` (§4.4/§5.1/§16) → DESIGN-SYSTEM **§7.4** (not §3.2).
4. **Owner:** approve the frontend toolchain list (`FRONTEND-ARCHITECTURE.md:15`) before the P1 scaffold.
5. **Owner:** approve design tokens/breakpoints/accessibility standard (UX-DEC-001/002/003/005) before visual implementation.
6. **Owner:** approve testing toolchain (RA-01) and CI design (RA-02) at P1.
7. Add version headers to `DATABASE-DESIGN.md` and `SECURITY.md` (informational).
8. Re-run this audit's matrix whenever any SSOT changes (`DEVELOPMENT-GUIDELINES.md §19`; `ROADMAP.md §12`).

---

## 13. Implementation Readiness Status

**READY WITH NON-BLOCKING ISSUES** — the documentation baseline is a consistent input for frontend implementation, but the following **must be approved before implementation starts** (none may be decided by implementers):

- Resolve F-1 and F-2 (Owner/CTO).
- Approve the frontend toolchain (FRONTEND §1.2 list) and testing/CI tooling (RA-01/RA-02).
- Approve design-system values and breakpoints (UX-DEC-001/002/005) and the accessibility standard (UX-DEC-003).
- Approve financial-path decisions the UI depends on: Idempotency-Key TTL (SA-04), rate-limit values (SA-03), CSRF mechanism (SA-02), DB-backed session store (DA-04).

Per the audit's standing rules, implementation is **not started** on the basis of this report; the baseline is recorded and awaits explicit approval of the required decisions.

---

## 14. Validation performed

- All 21 documentation files plus `CHANGELOG.md` and the 12 ADR files were read in full (≈10,600 lines).
- Cross-references (precedence chains, section citations, decision IDs, endpoint numbers, invariants, error codes, state vocabularies) were verified by targeted searches; findings cite exact file:line evidence.
- No requirement, business rule, API contract, architecture decision, or security control was invented; all proposed items are flagged `PROPOSED` / `REQUIRES APPROVAL` / `TBD` per the project's status vocabulary.
- Both conflicts (F-1, F-2) are preserved rather than silently resolved, per `BUSINESS-RULES.md §13` and `CODE-REVIEW-GUIDELINES.md §6`.
- No secrets or sensitive values are contained in this report.
