# JAD — Product / UI / UX Specification SSOT (UI-UX.md)

> **Authority:** This document is the **authoritative source for product experience, user-interface behavior, information architecture, and interaction design** for the JA&D (JAD) system.
>
> **Precedence:** BUSINESS-RULES.md → REQUIREMENTS.md → FEATURES.md → ROADMAP.md → ARCHITECTURE.md → TECH-STACK.md → FOLDER-STRUCTURE.md → API-SPECIFICATION.md → **this document** → DESIGN-SYSTEM.md.
>
> **Governance:** UI/UX decisions are derived strictly from the approved business rules, requirements, features, roadmap, and architecture. If another document conflicts, do **not** silently overwrite. Identify the conflict, record the source, and mark unresolved items **REQUIRES APPROVAL**. No business rule, role, permission, workflow, or product behavior may be invented here.
>
> **Status vocabulary:** **CONFIRMED** = derived from approved SSOT decisions. **PROPOSED** = recommended UI/UX decision not yet formally approved. **ASSUMPTION** = working assumption. **REQUIRES APPROVAL** = material UI/UX decision needing Owner approval. **TBD** = unresolved; must not be invented.
>
> **Version:** Project 04 — Product / UI / UX (Baseline v1.0)
>
> **Current verified state:** Application code exists under `apps/web` (Member Web, React 19 + Vite 8) and `apps/admin` (Admin, React 19 + Vite), styling via CSS Modules + `tokens.css`/`DESIGN-SYSTEM.md`, `packages/contracts` Zod schemas, `packages/mock` local API — screens below are **implemented per phases** (P2..P10 member F1 F2-A/B), not just proposed. Legacy wording “documentation only” is stale.

## 1. Scope

### 1.1 Applications in scope

| App | Folder (FOLDER-STRUCTURE.md) | Roles served | Phases |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Member Web App** | `apps/web` | Member, Active + Qualified Member | P2..P10 |
| **Admin / Back-Office App** | `apps/admin` | Admin, Finance, Super Admin | P2..P11 |
| **Merchant Redemption Portal** | `apps/merchant` | Merchant | P8 |
| **API** (backend) | `apps/api` | (no UI; drives all apps) | P1..P12 |

> **CTO Signing Service** (ARCHITECTURE §4.1) is an external service with **no user-facing UI**. It is out of scope for this document except as an integration the Merchant/Admin voucher flows depend on (FEAT-052, FEAT-059).

### 1.2 Delivery model (CONFIRMED)

- **Responsive web first (ARCH-DEC-005, CONFIRMED):** all three apps are responsive web applications. Native mobile is revisited post-MVP under ARCH-DEC-006 (**REQUIRES APPROVAL**).
- **Session authentication (ARCH-DEC-007, CONFIRMED):** HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite cookies; all frontends authenticate via the shared session (API-SPECIFICATION §2).
- **Framework:** React + Vite SPAs (TECH-STACK §2, CONFIRMED). Routing, state, forms, and styling choices below are PROPOSED per TECH-STACK §2 unless noted.

### 1.3 Scope boundaries

- UI/UX must never present actions the business rules prohibit (e.g., edit/delete of financial records, withdrawal of Pending commissions, sale of arbitrary seller-created properties, purchase required for membership, multi-level commissions, refunds, money movement).
- Gated features (FEAT-017, FEAT-018, FEAT-022, FEAT-041, FEAT-047, FEAT-051, FEAT-058, FEAT-066, FEAT-069) and gated endpoints (API-SPECIFICATION #21, #42, #76, #80) must not surface **implementable** UI until the corresponding Owner decisions (OD-001..025) are approved. Their screens may exist only as **planned placeholders** clearly labeled `REQUIRES APPROVAL`.

---

## 2. UX Principles

### 2.1 Core principles (PROPOSED unless derived)

1. **Financial clarity first (CONFIRMED derivation).** Because the eWallet and commission state model is the product's core, every money value must be shown with an explicit status label (`Pending` / `Available`), exact decimal amounts, and the currency symbol (`₱` — BUSINESS-RULES §6 examples). Never display a computed total that mixes Pending and Available funds without labeling both (BI-002).
2. **Honesty of state (CONFIRMED derivation).** UI state labels must match BUSINESS-RULES.md §5 state models exactly (`Pending`, `Approved-Active`, `Rejected`; `Submitted`, `Admin Approved`, `Payment Verified`, `Qualifying Sale`, `LOCKED`; `Reserved`, `Completed`, `Rejected`; etc.). No invented states.
3. **No dead-ends, always a path forward.** Every rejection includes a **mandatory reason** (BR-REG-004, BR-SAL-005, BR-WDR-004) and a visible next action (resubmit, new request, or escalation to staff).
4. **Object-level trust (CONFIRMED derivation).** Members see only their own data (NFR-AUTHZ-002). The UI never renders another member's identifiers or resources; missing resources render as "not found" rather than revealing existence (API-SPECIFICATION §1.2, 404).
5. **Progressive disclosure.** Dense financial/operational data (ledger, genealogy, queues) is layered: summary → detail → history. Default views are summaries; deep history requires deliberate navigation.
6. **Staff queues over raw lists.** Admin/Finance/Super Admin views are organized around **work queues** (registrations, sales, payouts, withdrawals, exceptions) with clear per-item status, because every staff action is an audited decision (NFR-SEC-002, NFR-AUD-001).

### 2.2 Usability principles

- **Learner-friendly core paths:** registration, sale submission, and withdrawal must require no training; help text explains eligibility gates (e.g., "You must be Active + Qualified to submit a sale — BR-SAL-001").
- **Efficiency for operators:** Admin/Final decision screens support keyboard-first review (approve/reject shortcuts), batching where safe, and persistent filters.
- **Consistent patterns:** one pattern per intent across all three apps (see §8 Interaction Patterns).

### 2.3 Clarity and consistency

- Terminology, labels, and status names match the SSOT exactly. A Pending commission is always "Pending" everywhere; a sale that passed approval but not payment verification is "Admin Approved", never "Pending approval" or "Half-done".
- Consistent placement of primary actions, cancel, and back navigation within each app.
- Money input/display is identical everywhere (see DESIGN-SYSTEM.md §1).

### 2.4 User efficiency

- **Pre-fill from catalog:** sale submission selects Property from the Admin catalog (FR-PRP-003) — the Property Value is a read-only snapshot at submission (BR-PRP-004, BI-006).
- **Idempotent submits:** Sale, withdrawal, redemption, and adjustment submissions carry an `Idempotency-Key` (API-SPECIFICATION §5.3). The UI generates and retains the key per submission so retries after network failure never double-apply (BI-007, BR-WDR-002).
- **Persistent filters** in staff queues; **saved page state** in member lists.

### 2.5 Error prevention and recovery

- Prevent errors at the source: constrained inputs (money as exact decimals, dropdowns from config for Gender per BR-REG-011), confirmation on destructive/irreversible actions, and warnings before actions with irreversible consequences (e.g., submitting a sale snapshots the property value).
- All server errors map to the API error envelope codes (API-SPECIFICATION §3) and surface human-readable, actionable messages (see §10 UI States).
- **Recovery is explicit:** a rejected withdrawal cannot be edited/resubmitted (BR-WDR-005) — the UI must say so and start a **new** request rather than pretending to reuse the old one.

### 2.6 Accessibility-first principles

- No approved accessibility NFR exists in REQUIREMENTS.md. The following are **PROPOSED platform standards** (RECOMMENDED — REQUIRES APPROVAL): semantic HTML, full keyboard operability, visible focus, WCAG-2.1 AA contrast, screen-reader labels, touch targets ≥ 44px, and reduced-motion support. See §12 Accessibility and DESIGN-SYSTEM.md §7.
- Accessibility is applied to all three apps from first build, not retrofitted.

- **Success:** Account created in `Pending`; confirmation screen explains next steps (Admin ID verification + approval).
- **Failure/recovery:** Age blocked at registration with explanation (AC-REG-001a). Missing fields shown inline. If rejected later by Admin: see 3.3.
- **Completion state:** `Pending` account awaiting Admin review.
- **Related:** FR-REG-001..012, FR-AUTH-001..003, FR-MEM-001, FEAT-007..013, BR-REG-001..011, BR-AUTH-001..003, AC-REG-001.

### 3.2 Abroad applicant — Geolocation (P11, confirmed mechanics only)

- **Actor:** Applicant registering for the Abroad program.
- **Entry point:** Registration → program selector → "Abroad".
- **Goal:** Prove Abroad location and continue registration.
- **Preconditions:** Program configuration exists (FEAT-068); geolocation mechanics FEAT-014..016 confirmed. Accuracy threshold (FEAT-017) and anti-spoofing (FEAT-018) are **BLOCKED on OD-014/OD-015** and must not be surfaced as enforced controls.
- **Main steps:** (1) Device location requested (browser geolocation — ARCH-DEC-005) with a clear privacy prompt; (2) fallback to IP geolocation if device location unavailable (FR-GEO-002); (3) system determines country.
- **Decisions:** If detected in the **Philippines**, Abroad registration is **blocked** with no bypass except an approved exception (BR-GEO-002, FR-GEO-003).
- **Validation:** Location determination result; exception requests are audited (FR-GEO-006).
- **Success:** Location accepted → continue to registration steps.
- **Failure/recovery:** PH block screen explains the program rule and offers "Request location exception" (FR-GEO-004, FEAT-016) → Admin review → result is audited and communicated.
- **Completion state:** Location verified OR exception submitted for Admin review.
- **Related:** FR-GEO-001..006, FEAT-014..016, FEAT-068, BR-GEO-001..004, AC-GEO-001, OD-014, OD-015.

- **Related:** FR-REG-004/005, FEAT-011, BR-REG-004/005, AC-REG-001c, OD-024.

### 3.4 Active + Qualified Member — Submit Sale → Qualifying Sale (core revenue path, P4/P5)

- **Actor:** Active + Qualified Member (BR-SAL-001, FEAT-023).
- **Entry point:** Member app → Sales → "Submit sale" (SCR-MEM-006).
- **Goal:** Record a customer sale and progress it to a Qualifying Sale.
- **Preconditions:** Member is Active + Qualified; Admin catalog has properties (FEAT-025); customer record exists or is created (FEAT-024).
- **Main steps:** (1) Select existing customer or record a non-member customer (FR-CUS-001/002); (2) select Property from the Admin catalog — Property Value shown read-only as the snapshot to be recorded (FR-PRP-003, BI-006); (3) review submission summary; (4) submit with `Idempotency-Key`.
- **Decisions:** Which customer; which catalog property.
- **Validation:** Eligible seller (422 `MEMBER_NOT_QUALIFIED` otherwise — API-SPECIFICATION §2.2); property from catalog only; idempotency enforced.
- **Success:** Sale created `Submitted` → visible in member's Sales list.
- **Failure/recovery:** Network failure → retry reuses the same `Idempotency-Key`, never double-submits. Business rejection → see 3.5.
- **Completion state:** `Submitted`, awaiting Admin approval.
- **Related:** FR-SAL-001..004, FR-CUS-001/002, FR-PRP-001..004, FEAT-024..030, BR-SAL-001..004, BR-CUS-001/002, BR-PRP-001..004, AC-SAL-001, AC-COM-001.

### 3.5 Member — Sale Rejection, Correction, Lock

- **Actor:** Active + Qualified Member.
- **Entry point:** Sale detail (SCR-MEM-007) after Admin rejection.
- **Goal:** Correct and resubmit a rejected sale.
- **Preconditions:** Sale `Rejected` with mandatory reason (BR-SAL-005).
- **Main steps:** (1) Read rejection reason; (2) correct applicable information; (3) resubmit (counts toward the configured maximum, FR-SAL-006/BR-SAL-006, FEAT-031).
- **Decisions:** Whether to correct/resubmit; whether to request reopen if locked.
- **Validation:** Resubmission attempts tracked; at the configured maximum the sale is **LOCKED** (FR-SAL-006).
- **Success:** Sale re-enters the approval flow.
- **Failure/recovery:** If `LOCKED`, the member cannot resubmit; the screen explains the state and that reopening requires Admin/Super Admin review (FR-SAL-007, FEAT-032).
- **Completion state:** `Submitted` (again) or `LOCKED`.
- **Related:** FR-SAL-005..007, FEAT-028/031/032, BR-SAL-005..007, AC-SAL-001d/e.

### 3.6 Member — Commission to eWallet (P5/P6)

- **Actor:** Active + Qualified Member (and direct sponsor, where applicable).
- **Entry point:** Qualifying Sale event → commission screens (SCR-MEM-015) and eWallet (SCR-MEM-008).
- **Goal:** See commissions move Pending → Available and into the eWallet.
- **Preconditions:** Qualifying Sale (BR-SAL-004); Direct Commission 8% (BR-COM-001) and/or Direct Referral 4% to direct sponsor (BR-COM-002, BI-003).
- **Main steps:** (1) Commission appears immediately as **Pending** (FR-COM-005); (2) after the configured clearing period (default 7 days, FR-COM-007/BR-COM-007) it becomes **Available** and is credited to eWallet Available Balance (FR-COM-008, BR-CLC-001).
- **Decisions:** None by the member (automatic lifecycle). Cancellation scenarios are staff/system-driven (FR-COM-009/010).
- **Validation:** Pending is never included in Available Balance (FR-COM-006, BI-002); ledger append-only (FR-COM-012, BI-005).
- **Success:** Available Balance reflects cleared commissions.
- **Failure/recovery:** Cancelled (pre-clearing) or Reversed (post-clearing) commissions are shown with the correct status and reference the original immutable transaction (BR-CAN-001/002). If already withdrawn and reversed, Super Admin resolves/recoveries (BR-CAN-003).
- **Completion state:** Commission `Available`, `Cancelled`, or `Reversed`; ledger immutable.
- **Related:** FR-COM-001..012, FEAT-033..040, FR-WAL-001..004, FEAT-042/043, BR-COM-001..007, BR-CLC-001/002, BR-CAN-001..004, BR-LED-001/002, AC-COM-001/002, AC-WAL-001.

### 3.7 Member — Request Withdrawal (P7)

- **Actor:** Member with Available Balance.
- **Entry point:** eWallet (SCR-MEM-008) → "Withdraw" (SCR-MEM-012).
- **Goal:** Withdraw up to Available Balance to a verified payout account.
- **Preconditions:** Available Balance > 0; at least one **verified** payout account (FR-PAY-005, FEAT-046).
- **Main steps:** (1) Review Available Balance and Pending amount (excluded — BI-002); (2) choose a verified payout account (only verified are selectable, FEAT-046); (3) enter amount ≤ Available (FR-WDR-001); (4) confirm — amount is **Reserved** immediately (FR-WDR-002, FEAT-048) and no longer reusable; submission carries `Idempotency-Key`.
- **Decisions:** Which payout account; how much.
- **Validation:** Amount ≤ Available Balance (409 `INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE`); verified account only (422 `PAYOUT_ACCOUNT_UNVERIFIED`); idempotent reservation.
- **Success:** Withdrawal `Reserved`; Available Balance reduced by the reserved amount.
- **Failure/recovery:** Rejection (reason required) releases the reservation and restores the balance; the UI tells the member to create a **new** request — the rejected one cannot be edited or resubmitted (FR-WDR-004/005, BR-WDR-004/005).
- **Completion state:** `Reserved` → `Completed` (permanently deducted) or `Rejected` (released). Final withdrawal status model is **TBD (OD-017/018)**; no invented states.
- **Related:** FR-WDR-001..005, FEAT-046/048/049/050, FR-PAY-001..006, FEAT-044..047, BR-WDR-001..005, BR-PAY-001..006, AC-WDR-001, OD-016..018.

- **Actor:** Active + Qualified Member.
- **Entry point:** Referral area (SCR-MEM-003).
- **Goal:** Share a unique referral code and earn Direct Referral commission.
- **Preconditions:** Active + Qualified (BR-REF-003, FEAT-023); unique auto-generated code (BR-REF-004, FEAT-019).
- **Main steps:** (1) View/copy referral code (immutable — BR-REF-004/005, BI-009); (2) share via Messenger/Viber or download permitted materials (FR-ADM-003, FEAT-061); (3) referred member registers with the code (BR-REF-009).
- **Decisions:** Sharing channel.
- **Validation:** Code is unique and member-immutable; relationships are strictly single-level (BR-REF-001/002, BI-003/004).
- **Success:** Direct referrals appear in Direct Referrals (FEAT-064) and My Genealogy (FEAT-067) — reporting only, never implying multi-level commission (BR-RPT-001/004).
- **Failure/recovery:** Sponsor change is NOT a member action; requires Admin approval and audit (BR-REF-007, FEAT-022 — circumstances gated OD-013).
- **Completion state:** Referral relationships persisted and reportable.
- **Related:** FR-REF-001..006, FEAT-019..021/023, FEAT-061/064/067, BR-REF-001..006, BR-RPT-001/004, AC-REF-001, OD-013.

- **Goal:** Visualize referral network without implying multi-level commissions.
- **Preconditions:** Referral data exists (FEAT-021); ledger exists for Total Earned (FEAT-042).
- **Main steps:** (1) View single-level Direct Referrals (FR-RPT-001); (2) view Group Network as a reporting/network concept only (FR-RPT-002); (3) view My Genealogy tree (FR-RPT-004).
- **Decisions:** Scope of visualization (direct level / network).
- **Validation:** No screen may imply or compute multi-level commission (BI-004).
- **Success:** Clear, honest network visualization.
- **Failure/recovery:** Total Earned (FR-RPT-003) is **BLOCKED on OD-025**; until defined it must exclude pending/non-available funds and its screen is a labeled placeholder.
- **Completion state:** Reporting views consistent with the single-level model.
- **Related:** FR-RPT-001..004, FEAT-064..067, BR-RPT-001..004, BI-004, OD-025.

- **Validation:** All verification checks pass; atomicity prevents double redemption (NFR-ATOM-001).
- **Success:** Redemption result shows redeemed amount and remaining value.
- **Failure/recovery:** Error codes surface directly (e.g., `VOUCHER_INVALID_SIGNATURE`, `VOUCHER_EXPIRED`, `VOUCHER_ALREADY_REDEEMED`); offline redemption is impossible by design (BR-VCH-004).
- **Completion state:** Redemption recorded; remaining value updated (FEAT-054).
- **Related:** FR-VCH-001..006, FEAT-053..057, BR-VCH-001..006, BI-007, AC-VCH-001, OD-019..023.

### 3.17 Member — Vouchers (P8)

- **Actor:** Member.
- **Entry point:** Vouchers area (SCR-MEM-020).
- **Goal:** View own vouchers and remaining value.
- **Preconditions:** Voucher issued via CTO signing service (FEAT-052); member holds the voucher.
- **Main steps:** (1) List own vouchers (GET /me/vouchers); (2) view detail incl. remaining value (FR-VCH-001/002) and redemption history where permitted.
- **Success:** Accurate voucher state.
- **Failure/recovery:** Transfer/revocation/expiry/permission rules are **TBD (OD-019..023)** — the UI must not expose them until approved (FEAT-058).
- **Completion state:** Voucher state visible and accurate.
- **Related:** FR-VCH-001..003, FEAT-053/054, BR-VCH-001..003, OD-019..023.

### 3.18 Admin — Content, Policies & Broadcasts (P9)

- **Actor:** Admin.
- **Entry point:** Content area (SCR-ADM-014/015/016).
- **Goal:** Manage media, policies/guidelines/T&C, and broadcasts.
- **Main steps:** (1) Upload/manage media incl. photos, videos, ad images, landing pages, promos (FR-ADM-002); (2) manage policies, program guidelines, T&C, company rules (FR-ADM-004); (3) broadcast promotions, training invites (Zoom/Meet), announcements, push (FR-ADM-005).
- **Validation:** Only permitted content is forwardable/downloadable (BR-MKT-002); push depends on external infrastructure (ASSUMPTION 6).
- **Success:** Content live for members/public.
- **Completion state:** Published content; broadcast dispatched.
- **Related:** FR-ADM-002..005, FEAT-060..063, BR-MKT-001/002, BR-NOT-001/002.

### 3.19 Super Admin — Program Configuration (P11, gated)

- **Actor:** Super Admin.
- **Entry point:** Programs (SCR-ADM-022).
- **Goal:** Configure Domestic/Abroad independently (FR-PRG-002, FEAT-068).
- **Preconditions:** Program separation confirmed; **exact rule differences gated OD-001..005** (FEAT-069).
- **Main steps:** Independent configuration of registration rules, qualification questions, geolocation requirements, commission rates, referral rules, incentive rules, eligible properties/products (FR-PRG-002).
- **Completion state:** Program config persisted. Detailed rules remain **BLOCKED** until OD-001..005.
- **Related:** FR-PRG-001/002, FEAT-068/069, BR-PRG-001/002, OD-001..005.

### 4.2 Primary navigation (CONFIRMED derivation)

- **Member app:** persistent top/side navigation: Dashboard, **Sales & Earnings** (`Sales`, `Qualification`, `Commissions`, `eWallet`/`Ledger`, `Withdrawals`, `Payouts`), `Referrals` (Direct/Group/Genealogy/Total Earned), `Resources` (Vouchers, News, Policies, Notifications), `Profile`. Secondary: reporting (Direct Referrals, Group Network, My Genealogy) nested under Referrals, matching FEAT groups FG-SALES, FG-EWALLET, FG-WDR, FG-PAYOUT, FG-REF, FG-VOUCHER, FG-CONTENT, FG-REPORTING, FG-MEMBERS. `Commissions` sits directly after `Sales` per `Sale → Commission → eWallet` spine `§5.5`.
- **Admin app:** queue-driven: Dashboard, Registrations, Sales, Payouts, Withdrawals, Exceptions, Catalog, Members, Content, Vouchers; Super Admin-only: Adjustments, Config, Programs, Audit. Role visibility per BUSINESS-RULES §3.
- **Merchant portal:** single-purpose flow (redemption + result); no secondary navigation.

### 4.3 Secondary navigation

- In-page tabs for multi-part resources: e.g., Ledger (Available/Pending summary vs full history), Member detail (Profile / Sales / Ledger / Payouts / Withdrawals).
- Contextual: breadcrumbs in deep operational screens (Admin app) and wallet/reporting (Member app).

### 4.4 Contextual navigation

- **Sale detail:** actions surface only when the state permits (e.g., "Resubmit" only when `Rejected`; "Verify payment" only when `Admin Approved`). This mirrors the state models (BUSINESS-RULES §5) and API action endpoints.
- **eWallet:** "Withdraw" surfaces when Available Balance > 0 and a verified account exists; otherwise a helpful explanatory state links to Payouts or Qualification.

### 4.5 Role/permission-dependent navigation

- Member nav item "Submit sale" requires role Member **and** status Active + Qualified (BR-SAL-001). For non-qualified members, show the item disabled with an explanatory link to Qualification status (SCR-MEM-004) — never a 403 dead-end.
- Admin-only and Super Admin-only items are **not rendered** for other staff roles (least privilege, NFR-SEC-001). Finance sees Sales queue (payment verification) and Withdrawals; Finance does **not** see Adjustments/Config (BR-ADJ-001).
- Merchant portal is a separate app; no cross-app navigation.

### 4.6 Mobile navigation behavior

- Member app: bottom navigation for the 5 most frequent destinations (Dashboard, Sales, eWallet, Referrals, Notifications); the rest via a drawer ("More"). 
- Admin app: persistent drawer with queue badges.
- No desktop-layout shrink (see §11 Responsive).

### 4.7 Breadcrumbs / back navigation

- Deep screens (sale detail, ledger, genealogy, registration detail, voucher detail) show a path back to their queue/section. Back must preserve filters/scroll state where practical.

---

## 5. Information Architecture

### 5.1 Content hierarchy

1. **Identity & status first** — the member's membership status, program (Domestic/Abroad), and key financial figures (Available vs Pending) are the top-level, persistent context.
2. **Workflows** — registration, sale, withdrawal, redemption, verification — are step-sequenced flows.
3. **Reference/records** — ledger, commissions, referrals, genealogy — are read-first, layered views.
4. **Governance** — Admin config, programs, policies, audit — are staff-only, permission-gated areas.

### 5.2 Major entities / content areas

| Entity | Screen(s) | Source of truth |
|---|---|---|
| Member / Applicant | SCR-AUTH-002..005, SCR-MEM-002, SCR-ADM-002..005 | FR-MEM-001, FR-REG-* |
| Referral relationship | SCR-MEM-003/016/017/018 | FR-REF-*, FR-RPT-* |
| Property catalog | SCR-ADM-006/007, SCR-MEM-006 (picker) | FR-PRP-* |
| Customer | SCR-MEM-006 (record), SCR-ADM-009 | FR-CUS-* |
| Sale | SCR-MEM-005..007, SCR-ADM-008/009 | FR-SAL-* |
| Commission | SCR-MEM-015, SCR-ADM-018 | FR-COM-* |
| eWallet / Ledger | SCR-MEM-008/009 | FR-WAL-* |
| Payout account | SCR-MEM-010/011, SCR-ADM-010 | FR-PAY-* |
| Withdrawal | SCR-MEM-012..014, SCR-ADM-011/012 | FR-WDR-* |
| Voucher | SCR-MEM-020/021, SCR-MCH-002/003, SCR-ADM-017 | FR-VCH-* |
| Content / Policy / Broadcast | SCR-MEM-022..024, SCR-ADM-014..016 | FR-ADM-002..005 |
| Program config | SCR-ADM-022 | FR-PRG-* |
| Platform config | SCR-ADM-019 | FR-ADM-001 |
| Audit trail | SCR-ADM-021 | FR-ADM-* (NFR-AUD-001) |

### 5.3 Grouping and categorization

- Group by **feature group** (FG-*) to mirror modules and folder structure (FOLDER-STRUCTURE §2.1): Sales under FG-SALES, eWallet+Withdrawals under FG-EWALLET/FG-WDR, etc.
- Staff screens grouped by **workflow**: Verification (IDs, payouts), Approvals (registrations, sales), Exceptions (location, sponsor, locks), Governance (config, adjustments, audit, programs).

### 5.4 Naming conventions

- Screen names and labels match SSOT terminology exactly (e.g., "Active + Qualified", "Qualifying Sale", "Available Balance", "Pending", "Direct Referral", "My Genealogy", "Direct Referrals", "Group Network", "Total Earned").
- Money always labeled with currency (₱) and status when ambiguous (Pending/Available).
- Status labels use the confirmed state vocabulary (BUSINESS-RULES §5).

### 5.5 Relationships between screens

- **Sale → Commission → eWallet → Withdrawal** is the spine: each screen links to its financial consequence (a Qualifying Sale links to its commission entries; a commission entry links to the ledger; the ledger is the source of Available Balance shown on the wallet; the wallet drives withdrawal).
- **Registration → Approval → Member**: Admin actions on a registration flow into the member record.
- **Referral → Genealogy**: referral relationships feed Direct Referrals and My Genealogy (reporting only, BI-004).

---

## 8. Interaction Patterns

### 8.1 Create / Edit / Delete

- **Create:** consistent form pattern (see §9). Creates map to `POST`; non-financial edits map to `PATCH` (API-SPECIFICATION §1.2).
- **Edit:** restricted to **mutable, non-financial** fields (e.g., profile fields except Country — BR-REG-010; payout account primary designation — FR-PAY-006; policies — FR-ADM-004). Financial records are **never editable or deletable** (FR-COM-012, BI-005) — there is **no edit/delete affordance** on ledger, commissions, or any financial record.
- **Delete:** `DELETE` is allowed only on reversible, approved resources (API-SPECIFICATION §1.2). Where permitted, destructive delete requires the standard destructive-action confirmation (§8.5). Nothing financial is deletable.

### 8.2 Search / Filter / Sort

- Member and Admin lists support filtering by allowlisted keys and statuses (API-SPECIFICATION §4); sorting only by allowlisted fields. Filters are persistent per staff queue.
- Global search is a **PROPOSED enhancement** (REQUIRES APPROVAL) — not required by any confirmed feature.

### 8.3 Selection

- Radio for single choice; checkboxes for multi-select; catalog/property and payout-account pickers are constrained (catalog only — BR-PRP-003; verified only — FR-PAY-005).
- Money selection uses exact decimal inputs, never slider-based money.

### 8.4 Confirmation

- Required for all **irreversible** or high-impact actions: submit sale (snapshots value, BI-006), request withdrawal (reserves funds, FR-WDR-002), apply financial adjustment, redeem voucher, approve/reject/reopen/cancel any sale, issue voucher.
- Confirmations restate the consequence in plain language and include the affected amount/record.

### 8.5 Destructive actions

- Destructive = irreversible or financially consequential (rejections, cancellations, adjustments, reopening, voucher issue/redemption). Pattern: explicit action → typed/acknowledged confirmation → **mandatory reason field** (BR-REG-004, BR-SAL-005, BR-WDR-004) → audited result (NFR-SEC-002). No "undo" for financial records (BI-005); corrections are new transactions (BR-LED-002).

### 8.6 Pagination

- Member ledger and other financial streams: **cursor pagination** (API-SPECIFICATION §4) with loading state and preserved position.
- Admin lists: **page-based** pagination (`page`/`pageSize`), with counts. Never unbounded responses.

### 8.7 Tabs

- Used for multi-part entities (Ledger summary vs history; Member detail profile/sales/ledger). Tabs never hide conflicting states; the tab label reflects SSOT state vocabulary.

### 8.8 Dropdowns

- Used for constrained selection (Gender from config — BR-REG-011; program choice; payout account; property from catalog). Config-driven options come from the config service (FEAT-005); the UI never hard-codes configurable values.

### 8.9 Tooltips

- Help context for eligibility gates and financial semantics (e.g., "Pending commissions are not available for withdrawal — BI-002"). Tooltips never contain the sole source of critical info; they complement visible labels.

### 8.10 Expand / collapse

- Dense records (ledger entry details, genealogy branches, audit entries) use progressive disclosure. Default = collapsed; key data (amount, status, date) always visible.

### 8.11 Navigation

- See §4. Cross-section links preserve context (e.g., ledger entry → related sale → commission).

### 8.12 Feedback

- All mutations produce inline feedback (toast/alert per DESIGN-SYSTEM.md §6). Failure feedback maps the API error code to an actionable message (§10). Success feedback states the new record/status (e.g., "Withdrawal requested — ₱12,000.00 reserved").

---

## 9. Forms

### 9.1 Form structure

- Single-column forms on mobile; two-column only for compact non-financial fields on desktop.
- Fields grouped in logical sections (identity, contact, financial, documents) with section headings matching SSOT terms.
- The most important action (submit) is the primary button; cancel/back is secondary and never destructive.

### 9.2 Labels

- Visible labels always (never placeholder-only). Required fields marked; optional fields clearly labeled "Optional" (e.g., referral code — BR-REG-009, profile photo — FR-MEM-001).

### 9.3 Required / optional fields

- Derived from requirements: profile fields per FR-MEM-001; qualification questions required (FR-REG-003); ID required (FR-REG-002); referral code optional (BR-REG-009); profile photo optional (FR-MEM-001); rejection/adjustment reasons mandatory (BR-REG-004, BR-SAL-005, BR-WDR-004, FR-ADJ-002).

### 9.4 Validation

- Client-side validation for format/bounds (age, exact-decimal money, phone/email) mirrors server Zod schemas (API-SPECIFICATION §1.3). Business validation (eligibility, balance, status) is **server-authoritative**; the UI surfaces server messages verbatim.

### 9.5 Inline errors

- Errors appear inline at the offending field plus a form-level summary. Server error codes map to readable text; retry-safe submissions use the same `Idempotency-Key`.

### 9.6 Submission behavior

- Submissions that carry `Idempotency-Key` (sales, withdrawals, redemptions, adjustments) are single-submit; the button disables while pending; retries reuse the key (API-SPECIFICATION §5.3). Show a clear "submitting" state; never allow a second concurrent submit.

### 9.7 Unsaved changes

- Leaving a form with unsaved changes triggers a confirm dialog. This is especially important where data entry is long (registration, sale submission, adjustment).

### 9.8 Disabled states

- Fields/actions disabled when ineligible, with an adjacent explanation and, where applicable, a link to the qualifying screen (e.g., sale submission disabled for non-AQ members → Qualification status). Never disable without explanation.

### 9.9 Accessibility requirements

- Labels associated programmatically; error messages linked to fields (`aria-describedby`); focus moves to the first error; forms operable by keyboard and assistive tech (see §12 and DESIGN-SYSTEM.md §7).

---

## 10. UI States

Standard states, their triggers, and required content. States are PROPOSED platform standards (no approved NFR targets); the *trigger* mapping to API error codes is CONFIRMED from API-SPECIFICATION §3.

| State | When | Required behavior |
|---|---|---|
| **Initial** | Screen load, no data fetched yet | Skeleton or structured placeholder; never blank. |
| **Loading** | Data fetching / mutation in flight | Visible progress; submit buttons disabled during idempotent submits; no double-submit. |
| **Empty** | No records yet (e.g., no sales, no withdrawals, no ledger entries) | Friendly empty state with the primary action to begin (e.g., "Submit your first sale"). Financial empty states must not imply balance (Available = ₱0.00 is a valid, shown state). |
| **Error** | API error | Map error code → readable message (API-SPECIFICATION §3); keep entered data; offer retry (reusing Idempotency-Key where applicable). |
| **Validation** | Input invalid | Inline errors; focus first invalid field; form summary. |
| **Success** | Mutation succeeded | Positive feedback with resulting record/status/amount. |
| **Disabled** | Ineligible action | Explain why + link to remedy (see §9.8). |
| **Unauthorized / forbidden** | 401 / 403 (session invalid, role/eligibility/ownership) | For 401: route to login preserving intended destination. For 403: clear message; never reveal existence of other members' records (404 hides others' resources — API-SPECIFICATION §1.2, §8). |
| **Network failure** | Offline / request failed | Offline banner; retry preserves in-progress form and Idempotency-Key; no data loss. |
| **Partial data** | Ledger/commission partly unavailable | Show available summary with explicit "partial" indicator; never present partial as complete. |
| **Confirmation** | Pre-destructive/high-impact action | Confirmation dialog restating consequence (§8.4). |
| **Destructive action** | Rejection/cancellation/adjustment/redemption | Mandatory reason input; typed confirmation; audit acknowledgment (NFR-SEC-002). |

## 11. Responsive Behavior

Approach: **adaptive, not shrink-to-fit.** Each app is designed per breakpoint (DESIGN-SYSTEM.md §5). Viewport targets: mobile (< 640px), tablet (640–1023px), desktop (≥ 1024px) — **PROPOSED breakpoints (REQUIRES APPROVAL)**.

### 11.1 Desktop (≥ 1024px)

- Persistent side/top navigation; multi-column layouts for queues, tables, dashboards.
- Dense tables with sortable columns (Admin queues, ledger, commissions).

### 11.2 Tablet (640–1023px)

- Collapsible navigation (drawer); 2-column layouts collapse to 1–2; tables scroll horizontally or convert critical columns to cards.

### 11.3 Mobile (< 640px)

- Bottom navigation (Member app) / drawer (Admin app); single-column forms; **tables become stacked cards** (key fields first: status, amount, date); modals become full-screen sheets; touch targets ≥ 44px; money values always fully visible (never truncated without a detail view).

### 11.4 Different viewports / overflow

- Financial tables never horizontally scroll on mobile without a card fallback; long ledger rows wrap or expand (progressive disclosure); large trees (genealogy) virtualize.

### 11.5 Touch interaction

- Primary actions reachable with thumb (bottom placement on mobile); swipe is optional and never the only path; no hover-only affordances.

### 11.6 Keyboard interaction

- All actions reachable by keyboard (Tab order logical, Enter/Space activate); visible focus (see §12). Admin approval screens support keyboard-only review.

### 11.7 Tables / data-dense interfaces

- Column priority collapse on small screens: keep status, amount, date; hide secondary columns behind expand.

### 11.8 Forms

- Single column; inputs full width; numeric/money keyboards on mobile; autofill supported for identity fields where permitted by privacy (NFR-CONF-001, NFR-DATA-001).

### 11.9 Navigation

- Mobile patterns per §4.6; no hidden hamburger-only menus on desktop.

### 11.10 Dialogs / modals

- Full-screen on mobile; centered dialog on desktop; never render destructive confirmations without the standard confirmation pattern (§8.4/§8.5).

### 11.11 Overflow / content wrapping

- Money and statuses never wrap mid-token; long text truncates with expand; dates use a single approved format per locale.

---

## 12. Accessibility

> **Status:** No accessibility NFR exists in REQUIREMENTS.md. The following are **PROPOSED platform standards (RECOMMENDED — REQUIRES APPROVAL)**. They apply to all three apps from P1 forward.

### 12.1 Semantic HTML
- Use native landmarks (header, nav, main, aside, footer), headings in hierarchy, and native form controls before custom widgets.

### 12.2 Keyboard navigation
- Complete keyboard operability: logical tab order, Enter/Space activation, Escape closes dialogs, arrow keys for menus/tabs/tree. No keyboard traps.

### 12.3 Focus management
- Visible focus indicator (WCAG-2.1 AA); focus moves sensibly on dialog open/close, inline error, and state changes; skip-to-content link.

### 12.4 Screen readers
- Meaningful accessible names for all controls; status/state changes announced (aria-live for success/error/toast); tables with proper headers; icons with text alternatives.

### 12.5 Labels
- Visible, programmatically-associated labels (§9.2); error messages linked to fields (aria-describedby).

### 12.6 Error messaging
- Errors announced and focusable; color is never the only indicator (also use icon + text).

### 12.7 Contrast
- Text and interactive components meet WCAG-2.1 AA contrast (see DESIGN-SYSTEM.md §7.1).

### 12.8 Touch targets
- Interactive targets ≥ 44px (DESIGN-SYSTEM.md §7.3); adequate spacing between targets.

### 12.9 Reduced motion
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`: animations disabled/curtailed; no essential info conveyed by motion.

### 12.10 Accessible dialogs/forms/tables
- Dialogs: focus management, role=dialog, aria-modal, Escape. Forms/tables per above. `prefers-reduced-data` considered where image-heavy (PROPOSED).

---

## 13. UX Constraints

### 13.1 Known constraints (CONFIRMED derivation)
- **No money movement / no payment gateway / no refunds:** withdrawal and payment screens are **record-only** (BR-BND-001..003); no checkout, no card entry, no wallet-API UI.
- **Financial immutability:** no edit/delete UI on any financial record (FR-COM-012, BI-005); corrections via new transactions (BR-LED-002).
- **Pending ≠ Available:** every money view separates Pending from Available (BI-002); no UI implies Pending is spendable.
- **Balance non-negative:** withdrawal amounts capped at Available (BR-WDR-001, BI-001); UI never offers to exceed it.
- **Mandatory reasons** on member/sale/withdrawal rejection and adjustments (BR-REG-004, BR-SAL-005, BR-WDR-004, FR-ADJ-002).
- **Object-level privacy:** members see only own data; 404 for others' resources (NFR-AUTHZ-002, API-SPECIFICATION §1.2).
- **Country immutable** (BR-REG-010); **referral code immutable** (BR-REF-004/005, BI-009).
- **No purchase step** anywhere in registration (BR-REG-006).
- **No MLM:** genealogy/group-network UI must not imply commission entitlement (BI-004).

### 13.2 Technical constraints affecting UX
- **Responsive web only** for MVP (ARCH-DEC-005, CONFIRMED); browser geolocation for Abroad (FR-GEO-001) — accuracy/spoofing gated (OD-014/015).
- **Session cookies (HttpOnly)** — no client-side tokens; the UI relies on server sessions and refresh (ARCH-DEC-007).
- **Rate limiting** on auth and redemption (API-SPECIFICATION §5.2) — the UI must handle 429 with backoff messaging.
- **Idempotency-Key** required on sale/withdrawal/redemption/adjustment submits (API-SPECIFICATION §5.3) — the UI generates and persists keys.
- **CORS allowlist** (API-SPECIFICATION §8) — all apps are first-party origins.

### 13.3 Business constraints affecting UX
- Eligibility gating: sale submission and sponsoring require Active + Qualified (BR-SAL-001, BR-REF-003); UI reflects this with disabled states and links to qualification (FR-REG-008).
- Withdrawal requires a **verified** payout account (FR-PAY-005); provider set gated on OD-016.
- Voucher redemption is **online-only and atomic** (BR-VCH-004/006) — no offline mode, and simultaneous attempts produce exactly one success (BI-007).
- Staff actions are audited (NFR-SEC-002); every staff decision screen implies an audit record.

### 13.4 Accessibility constraints
- No approved accessibility NFR (see §12); contrast/focus/touch/reduced-motion standards are PROPOSED and REQUIRE APPROVAL.

### 13.5 Security/privacy constraints
- Least-privilege role rendering (NFR-SEC-001, NFR-AUTHZ-001); PII (ID documents, phone, email, address, DOB) minimized in UI and never logged (NFR-CONF-001, NFR-DATA-001, API-SPECIFICATION §8).
- Government ID documents displayed only to authorized staff in verification contexts (FR-REG-002).

### 13.6 Explicitly unresolved UX decisions (REQUIRES APPROVAL / TBD)

| UX-DEC | Unresolved decision | Why it matters | Related | Status |

## 14. Traceability & Consistency

- Screen IDs, journeys, and patterns above reference only existing SSOT IDs: `FR-*`, `NFR-*`, `FEAT-*`, `BR-*`, `BI-*`, `OD-*`, `AC-*`, `ARCH-DEC-*`, `FG-*` (see REQUIREMENTS.md, BUSINESS-RULES.md, FEATURES.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, API-SPECIFICATION.md).
- **New IDs introduced by this document:** `SCR-*` (screen register), `UX-DEC-*` (unresolved UX decisions), and journey labels `§3.x`. These are this document's own namespaces and are not claimed to exist elsewhere.
- Where a decision is not derivable from the SSOT it is marked `PROPOSED`, `REQUIRES APPROVAL`, or `TBD` — it is **never silently approved**.
- If REQUIREMENTS.md, BUSINESS-RULES.md, FEATURES.md, ROADMAP.md, or the architecture/API SSOT changes, re-verify this document's screen/journey/state mappings before proceeding.
