## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 System Purpose

JA&D (JAD) is a direct-selling and network-growth platform that enables **Active + Qualified members** to earn a **Direct Commission (8%)** on qualifying customer sales and a **Direct Referral commission (4%)** on qualifying sales made by members they directly referred, under a **strict Single-Level Referral** structure. Members manage earnings through a full **eWallet financial ledger** and may withdraw available funds through verified payout accounts. The system also provides **digital vouchers with QR redemption**, Admin-managed marketing/policy content, and separate **Domestic and Abroad** business programs.

### 1.2 System Boundaries

- JAD manages **records and business logic**: members, qualification, sales, commissions, eWallet ledger, withdrawals, payout accounts, vouchers/QR redemption.
- JAD **does not execute actual money movement**. Payment/payout execution occurs through external platforms (bank transfer, GCash, other approved providers).
- Payment gateway / card processing / wallet-payment-API / POS infrastructure is **OUT OF SCOPE**.
- Voucher **signing** is performed by a separately controlled, CTO-authorized signing process/service; the master key is never accessible to application infrastructure.

### 1.3 Major System Capabilities

- Member registration, verification, approval, and qualification (no purchase required).
- Single-Level referral structure with persistent, immutable referral codes.
- Admin-controlled property catalog with historical value preservation.
- Sale submission, admin approval, payment verification, and qualifying-sale determination.
- Commission engine: Direct Commission (8%) and Direct Referral (4%), configurable, with pending → clearing → available lifecycle.
- eWallet with a complete, immutable financial ledger and non-negative available balance.
- Payout accounts (multiple, admin-verified) and withdrawals with reservation.
- Digital vouchers with full/partial QR redemption, atomic and online-verified.
- Marketing, media, policies, notifications, and broadcasts.
- Reporting views: Direct Referrals, Group Network (no MLM implication), Total Earned, My Genealogy.
- Separate Domestic and Abroad program configuration.
- Role-based access for Super Admin, Admin, Finance, and Members; CTO-controlled signing boundary.

### 1.4 Intended Users

- **Members** (and **Active + Qualified Members**)
- **Admin**
- **Finance**
- **Super Admin**
- **Merchants** (voucher redemption)
- **CTO** (signing control)
- **Customers** (non-member; recorded by sellers)
- **External payment providers/platforms** (out-of-boundary integration points)

## 3. Scope

### 3.1 In Scope

All requirements listed in Sections 6 and 7 below whose status is **CONFIRMED** or **CONFIRMED / PROVISIONAL**, including:
- Registration, verification, approval, qualification, and member profiles.
- Single-Level referral and sponsor management.
- Admin-controlled property catalog with historical value preservation.
- Sales submission/approval/payment verification and qualifying-sale determination.

### 3.2 Out of Scope

The following must **not** be implemented as part of the current JAD scope without explicit authorization:
- Payment gateway development.
- Card processing infrastructure.
- Wallet/payment APIs for actual money movement.
- POS payment processing.
- Automatic customer refund system.
- Multi-level referral commissions / automatic downline commissions.
- Arbitrary seller-created properties.
- Editable historical commission transactions / editable historical sales values.

### 3.3 Future Scope

Only explicitly identified future scope may be listed here. TBD items are **not** silently moved into scope:
- Configurable maximum registration attempts (currently unlimited resubmission) — see OD-024.

All other open questions (see OD-001..025) remain **REQUIRES OWNER APPROVAL** and are **not** in scope until approved.

## 4. Actors and Roles

| Actor | System Role | Business Eligibility (separate concern) |
|---|---|---|
| **Member** | Authenticated member with registration, profile, ledger, payout, and referral views. | May register, qualify, view genealogy. |
| **Active + Qualified Member** | Member satisfying qualification criteria. | May refer (sponsor) and submit sales. |
| **Admin** | Operates verification, approval, catalog, and content workflows. | Performs ID verification, sale/payment/payout verification, geolocation exceptions, sponsor assignment. |
| **Finance** | Verifies payments. | Payment verification authority. |
| **Super Admin** | Global configuration and exception authority. | Configures business parameters; performs financial adjustments; resolves recovered amounts; reopens locked sales. |
| **Merchant** | Redeems vouchers online through JAD. | Subject to voucher verification rules. |
| **CTO** | Owns the master voucher signing key and authorizes the signing process/service. | Exclusive signing authority; no access by other actors. |
| **Customer** | Non-member recorded by a seller. | Not a system user; no self-service capabilities. |
| **External payment providers/platforms** | Execute actual money movement. | Out-of-boundary integration; JAD records only. |

**Note:** Role permissions and business eligibility are distinct. A role granting an action (e.g., Admin sale approval) does not change who is *business-eligible* (e.g., only Active + Qualified members may submit sales). See BUSINESS-RULES.md §3.

**Object-level authorization:** Members may access only their own records (profile, sales, ledger, payout accounts, withdrawals, genealogy). Staff roles may access records within their operational scope; all exception/override actions are audited.

## 9. Business Constraints

- **Single-Level Referral:** Direct Referral commission is paid only to the direct sponsor (BR-REF-001, BR-REF-002).
- **No multi-level direct referral commission** (BR-REF-002; BI-003, BI-004).
- **Admin-controlled properties** — no arbitrary seller-created properties (BR-PRP-001, BR-PRP-002).
- **Immutable financial records** — commissions and ledger entries cannot be edited/deleted (BR-LED-001; BI-005).
- **Pending commissions cannot be withdrawn** and are excluded from Available Balance (BR-COM-006; BI-002).
- **Available Balance must never become negative** (BR-WAL-002; BI-001).
- **Payment execution remains external** — JAD records only (BR-BND-001).
- **CTO-controlled signing key** — master key inaccessible to application infrastructure (BR-SEC-001..004; BI-008).
- **Domestic/Abroad may have separate rules** (BR-PRG-001, BR-PRG-002).
- **No general automatic refund workflow** (BR-CAN-004; BI-010).

## 10. Assumptions

The following are working assumptions, **not** confirmed requirements:

> **ASSUMPTION 1:** Authentication ("login") is a required platform capability for members and staff to exercise role-scoped functionality; no specific authentication mechanism or credential policy has been approved (see NFR-AUTH-001).

> **ASSUMPTION 2:** Email delivery (verification, notifications) is an external dependency; no specific provider or deliverability target has been approved.

> **ASSUMPTION 3:** Geolocation services (GPS/IP) are external dependencies; no specific provider or accuracy target has been approved (see OD-014, OD-015).

> **ASSUMPTION 4:** "Customers" are recorded by sellers and have no self-service access to the system (BR-CUS-001).

> **ASSUMPTION 5:** Payout "providers" (banks, GCash, etc.) are external; the final set is TBD (OD-016).

> **ASSUMPTION 6:** Push notification infrastructure is an external dependency (FR-ADM-005).

> **ASSUMPTION 7:** The CTO-controlled signing process/service is external to the application infrastructure (FR-SEC-001..004).

## 12. Acceptance Criteria

Objective, testable criteria for major requirements.

| AC ID | Requirement | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| AC-REG-001 | FR-REG-001..008 | Given a new applicant: (a) registration is blocked if declared age < configured minimum; (b) status is `Pending` until email verified, ID manually verified, and Admin approves; (c) if rejected, the reason is recorded and displayed and the applicant may resubmit; (d) status becomes `Approved-Active` only when all criteria are satisfied; (e) no purchase step exists at any point in the flow. |
| AC-GEO-001 | FR-GEO-001..006 | Given an Abroad registration: (a) device location is used first, IP as fallback; (b) if the applicant is in the Philippines, registration is blocked with no bypass path except an approved exception; (c) a location exception records applicant, Admin, date/time, reason, and result. |
| AC-REF-001 | FR-REF-001..006 | (a) Every member has a unique, auto-generated referral code that cannot be modified by the member; (b) only Active + Qualified members can become sponsors; (c) a referral relationship is single-level (member's direct referrer only); (d) a member who registered without a sponsor can be assigned one only via Admin approval. |
| AC-SAL-001 | FR-SAL-001..007 | (a) Only Active + Qualified members can submit sales; (b) a sale is Qualifying only after Admin approval and payment verification; (c) rejection requires a reason; (d) resubmission stops and the sale is LOCKED after the configured maximum attempts; (e) reopening a locked sale requires Admin/Super Admin review and is audited. |
| AC-COM-001 | FR-COM-001..008 | (a) Direct Commission = value × configurable rate (baseline 8%); (b) Direct Referral = value × configurable rate (baseline 4%) to the direct sponsor; (c) both may appear for the same qualifying sale; (d) commission is created Pending and does not appear in Available Balance; (e) after the configured clearing period (default 7 days) the commission becomes Available. |
| AC-COM-002 | FR-COM-009..012 | (a) Cancelling the transaction before clearing cancels the Pending commission; (b) cancelling after clearing creates a Commission Reversal leaving the original transaction immutable; (c) no commission record can be edited or deleted through any UI or API. |
| AC-WAL-001 | FR-WAL-001..004 | Given any sequence of ledger operations, Available Balance is never negative, and Pending commissions never contribute to it. |
| AC-WDR-001 | FR-WDR-001..005 | (a) A withdrawal request reserves the amount, which cannot be reused; (b) completion permanently deducts it; (c) rejection releases the reservation, restores the balance, records a reason, and requires a new request (the rejected request cannot be edited/resubmitted). |
| AC-VCH-001 | FR-VCH-001..006 | Given a merchant redemption attempt: (a) all listed verifications run online; (b) the redemption is atomic — two simultaneous attempts result in exactly one successful redemption; (c) partial redemption reduces remaining value correctly and history is recorded. |
| AC-SEC-001 | FR-SEC-001..004 | (a) No application component can access the master signing key; (b) signing is performed only through the CTO-authorized process/service; (c) a simulated application-infrastructure compromise does not expose the key. |
| AC-ADJ-001 | FR-ADJ-001..002 | Only Super Admin can perform a financial adjustment, and every adjustment records member, amount, credit/debit, reason, performing Super Admin, and date/time. |
| AC-BND-001 | FR-BND-001..003 | The system records payment/payout information without executing money movement, and exposes no payment gateway/processing capabilities. |
