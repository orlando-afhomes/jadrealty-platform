# Architectural Decision Records — JAD (JA&D) Platform

> **Purpose:** Log of the JA&D platform's major architectural decisions. Each ADR explains **why** a decision exists (Context / Problem / Options / Rationale / Trade-offs / Consequences), not merely what is implemented.
>
> **Source of truth:** ADRs are derived **only** from authoritative repository evidence — `ARCHITECTURE.md §16` (decision register), `TECH-STACK.md`, `API-SPECIFICATION.md`, `DATABASE-DESIGN.md`, `BUSINESS-RULES.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `DEPLOYMENT.md`, and the frontend/backend/mobile architecture documents. Decisions that cannot be confidently established from evidence are **not** recorded here (see "Documentation gaps").
>
> **Statuses:** **Accepted** = decision established by approved SSOT material (CONFIRMED in the source docs). **Proposed** = recommended, not yet approved (PROPOSED / REQUIRES APPROVAL in the source docs). **Superseded / Deprecated / Rejected** = for future use when a newer decision replaces an older one; superseded ADRs are preserved, never renumbered.
>
> **Relationship to ARCHITECTURE §16:** the ARCH-DEC-* register is the authoritative decision record; these ADRs are the detailed records of those decisions (plus decisions sourced from other SSOTs). ADR numbering starts at 001 — no ADR files previously existed.
>
> **Repository state:** the repository is **documentation-only**. No decision below is implemented or deployed; `Accepted` means the decision is established as the approved SSOT baseline, not that code exists.

## Adding or changing an ADR

1. Use the template in the ADRs below (`Status`, `Context`, `Problem`, `Options Considered`, `Decision`, `Rationale`, `Trade-offs`, `Consequences`, `Validation / Evidence`, `References`).
2. Number sequentially; **never renumber existing ADRs**.
3. When a newer decision replaces an older one, mark the older ADR `Superseded` with a reference to the replacement — do not delete it.
4. Do not formalize a decision as `Accepted` without authoritative evidence. Unverifiable decisions are reported as documentation gaps (see `CHANGELOG.md` and the validation notes in DEPLOYMENT.md §20).

## Known source inconsistency (to resolve with the owning human)

- **ARCH-DEC-006 is overloaded in the source docs:** ARCHITECTURE.md §16 defines it as the *CTO signing-service mechanism* (Cloud KMS / HSM; REQUIRES APPROVAL (CTO)), while ARCHITECTURE §3.5, TECH-STACK §4/§23, and MOBILE-ARCHITECTURE use it as the *native-mobile approval* (React Native NOT approved; revisited post-MVP). This ADR set preserves each source's usage — ADR-007 (signing mechanism) and ADR-005 (native mobile deferral) both cite ARCH-DEC-006 — and does **not** invent a resolution. This inconsistency should be reconciled by the Owner/CTO before implementation.

## Documentation gaps (decisions NOT recorded)

The following are **not** recorded as ADRs because evidence is insufficient or the item is open (must not be invented):

- **NFR numeric targets** (ARCH-DEC-009) — `TBD`; no decision exists to record.
- **Deployment provider/region/orchestrator** (ARCH-DEC-008) — `REQUIRES APPROVAL`; recorded as **ADR-012 (Proposed)** only to capture the intended shape, not an accepted provider.
- **CTO signing-service mechanism** (KMS / HSM / air-gapped) — CTO-chosen; not yet decided. Covered as the Proposed mechanism within **ADR-007**.
- **CSRF mechanism, rate-limit values, session-store and TTL choices, transaction-isolation strategy, scheduler/queue choice, Prisma-as-alternative** — `PROPOSED`/`REQUIRES APPROVAL` in the SSOTs; not yet decisions.
- **Any decision that would require changing BUSINESS-RULES, REQUIREMENTS, or ARCHITECTURE SSOT content** — excluded by the approval boundary; must not be invented.
