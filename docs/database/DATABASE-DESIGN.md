## 1. Document Control

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Document | Database Design (Database SSOT) |
| Repository path | `docs/database/DATABASE-DESIGN.md` |
| Status | DRAFT — awaiting implementation review |
| Version | 1.0 |
| Last updated | 2026-08-18 |
| Owner | Database Architect / Engineering |
| Approvers | Owner, CTO (security boundary items), Super Admin configuration owner |
| Governing SSOTs | BUSINESS-RULES, REQUIREMENTS, FEATURES, ROADMAP, ARCHITECTURE, API-SPECIFICATION, TECH-STACK, FOLDER-STRUCTURE, BACKEND-ARCHITECTURE, FRONTEND-ARCHITECTURE, DEVELOPMENT-GUIDELINES |
| Change control | Changes follow the precedence chain; conflicting SSOTs are flagged, not silently overwritten (BUSINESS-RULES §13 Conflict Handling). Any change affecting financial invariants, security boundaries, or destructive schema operations requires approval (§24, header approval boundaries). Version numbers for PostgreSQL/Drizzle remain `REQUIRES VERIFICATION` until manifests exist |

---

## 2. Purpose

Define the approved target database architecture and data model for the JAD realty platform so that it can be implemented, migrated, seeded, secured, and operated without re-deriving business meaning. This document is **implementation-ready** and must remain consistent with the SSOT hierarchy above.

This document **does not**:

- Invent business rules, rates, eligibility, status models, or workflow rules (these are owned by `BUSINESS-RULES.md`, `REQUIREMENTS.md`, `FEATURES.md`).
- Implement or execute migrations, or modify any actual database (explicitly out of scope for this task).
- Duplicate unrelated business rules already owned by other SSOTs.

---

## 3. Scope

**In scope:**

- Database technology, architecture, environments, schema organization, data ownership boundaries, security architecture.
- Entities, tables, columns, relationships, keys, indexes, constraints, uniqueness rules.
- Normalization approach, audit strategy, soft-deletion policy, data lifecycle, migration strategy, seed strategy.
- Performance considerations, backup/recovery considerations.
- Traceability to requirements, business rules, features, and API contracts.
- Open decisions (`REQUIRES APPROVAL`) and risks/assumptions.

**Out of scope (must not be introduced):**

- Payment gateway / card processing / wallet-payment-API / POS schema or capabilities (BR-BND-003, FR-BND-003).
- Any money-movement/execution schema (BR-BND-001).
- Multi-level referral commission schema or downline-commission tables (BR-REF-002, BR-RPT-002/004, BI-004).
- Automatic refund workflows (BR-CAN-004, BI-010).
- Any rule marked TBD silently converted into a design decision (BUSINESS-RULES §11).
- Group Incentive parameters (OD-006..012) — concept CONFIRMED only; schema type exists but is blocked pending Owner decisions.

## 4. Database Architecture

| Item | Choice | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Engine | **PostgreSQL via Supabase 15+** | **CONFIRMED** | ARCH-DEC-003, TECH-STACK §5, ARCHITECTURE §14, Q1 |
| Data access | **Supabase JS client + PostgreSQL RLS** for reads/writes (CMS `cms_contents` JSONB + `marketing-tools`); Drizzle + raw SQL **optional for future dedicated backend** | **CONFIRMED** (Supabase) / **PROPOSED** (Drizzle) | Q1, ARCH-DEC-004 (updated), TECH-STACK §6, BACKEND-ARCHITECTURE §5 |
| Money type | `NUMERIC` exact decimal — **never** floating point | **PROPOSED** (mandatory for BR-WAL-002) | TECH-STACK §5, API-SPECIFICATION §1.3, BR-WAL-002 |
| Constraints | CHECK (balance ≥ 0), unique (redemption), FKs | **PROPOSED** | TECH-STACK §5, BI-001, BI-007 |
| Snapshot | Property value stored on the sale record at submission | **CONFIRMED** rule → implementation **PROPOSED** | BI-006, BR-PRP-004, TECH-STACK §5 |
| Ledger design | **Append-only ledger table**; available balance derived/validated from the ledger | **PROPOSED** | TECH-STACK §5, BR-LED-001/002, BI-005 |
| Migrations | Drizzle Kit / versioned SQL migrations in-repo | **PROPOSED** | TECH-STACK §5/§6, BACKEND-ARCHITECTURE §5.2 |
| Transactions | ACID; default `READ COMMITTED`; explicit row locks; `SERIALIZABLE` where race-prevention demands (redemption, balance mutation) | **PROPOSED** | TECH-STACK §5, BACKEND-ARCHITECTURE §12 |
| Deployment | Containerized, **managed PostgreSQL** | **PROPOSED / REQUIRES APPROVAL** (provider/region OPEN) | ARCH-DEC-008 |
| Database name | Single primary database (proposal: `jad`) | **PROPOSED** | ARCHITECTURE §14 |
| Sharding | Not used — correctness over sharding | **CONFIRMED** principle | ARCHITECTURE §14 |

### 4.1 Database architecture (Q1 Vercel + Supabase)

- **Single relational database (PostgreSQL via Supabase), single `public` schema.** Vercel Functions share one Supabase Postgres ACID boundary; financial invariants are enforced at the DB layer (constraints, checks, RLS, transactions) — correctness over sharding (ARCHITECTURE §14, Q1).
- **All financial invariants enforced at DB layer:** BI-001 (available balance ≥ 0), BI-002 (pending not available), BI-005 (no UPDATE/DELETE on financial tables — schema/role-enforced), BI-007 (unique voucher redemption), BI-008 (signing key never stored/accessible to DBAs).
- **Ledger single-writer:** financial modules (`commission`, `ewallet`, `withdrawal`, `payout`, `voucher`) may only mutate the ledger through the ledger's own application services (ARCHITECTURE §6, BACKEND-ARCHITECTURE §2.3). The database enforces invariants; the single-writer rule is enforced at the application layer.
- **No microservice-per-entity fragmentation.** All tables live in one schema; module boundaries are logical (FOLDER-STRUCTURE §2.1), not physical.

### 4.2 Environment strategy

| Environment | Purpose | Data posture |
|---|---|---|
| Local dev | Engineers; isolated Postgres (container) | Seed reference data only; no real PII |
| Test / CI | Automated tests; disposable database | Synthetic data; `REQUIRES APPROVAL` for any real-data copy |
| Staging / UAT | Pre-production validation | Anonymized/synthetic data only |
| Production | Live JAD platform | Real data; strict least-privilege roles; backups per §21 |

> Environment provisioning is implementation detail; **database hosting provider/region is OPEN and `REQUIRES APPROVAL`** (ARCH-DEC-008).

### 4.3 Schema organization

- One database, one `public` schema (proposal). Table names are `snake_case`, plural, no module prefix (module ownership is documented in §7, not encoded in names).
- Shared cross-module enums/statuses live in `packages/contracts` and are mirrored as PostgreSQL CHECK constraints / native enums (see §12).
- Object storage for files (ID documents, media, profile photos) is **external** via infrastructure adapters (BACKEND-ARCHITECTURE §2.1, ARCHITECTURE §4.3); the database stores **metadata and storage references only**, never the binary blobs in the primary DB.

### 4.4 Data ownership boundaries

| Boundary | Owner | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Accounts, sessions, email verification | `auth` module | Auth tables only touched by `auth` repositories |
| Member profile, qualification, ID documents, geolocation, sponsor requests | `members` / `geolocation` / `referral` modules | Own their tables exclusively |
| Customers, properties | `catalog` module | Admin-controlled catalog (BR-PRP-001..003) |
| Sales, payment boundary records | `sales` module | Owns `sales`; commission/wallet read via contracts |
| Commissions | `commission` module | Immutable records (BI-005) |
| Ledger, balances, adjustments | `ewallet` module | **Single writer for ledger** (ARCHITECTURE §6) |
| Payout accounts, withdrawals | `payout` / `withdrawal` modules | Own their tables |
| Vouchers, redemptions | `voucher` module | Atomic redemption (BI-007) |
| Media, policies, broadcasts, notifications | `content` module | Own their tables |
| Config, programs, gender, countries | `config` / `programs` modules | Reference & configuration data (BR-CFG-001, BR-PRG-002) |
| Audit trail | `audit` module | Append-only; never modified/deleted |

> Rule: **only a module's repositories touch its tables** (FOLDER-STRUCTURE §2.2, BACKEND-ARCHITECTURE §2.3). Cross-module reads go through application contracts.

### 4.5 Security architecture

- **Roles mirror app roles** (NFR-SEC-001, NFR-AUTHZ-001): dedicated database roles for `app` (application), `migration`/`ddl` (schema changes), `reporting` (read-only), `audit` (append-only writer). See §22.
- **Least privilege:** application role holds only DML it needs; **REVOKE UPDATE/DELETE on financial tables** (commissions, ledger, financial adjustments, audit log, redemptions) enforces BI-005 at the schema level.
- **No direct production DB exposure:** database reachable only from the private network / app tier; no public internet exposure.
- **Sensitive data classification** on every column (§8): PII (member profile, ID documents, payout account details) and financial data are protected per NFR-CONF-001 / NFR-DATA-001; never logged in clear.
- **Signing boundary (BI-008, BR-SEC-002):** the master voucher signing key is **never** stored in this database and is **not** accessible to DBAs; only signed payloads and public-key verification material are persisted.
- **RLS (row-level security):** single-tenant platform; object-level authorization is enforced in the application layer (NFR-AUTHZ-002, API-SPECIFICATION §8 IDOR/BOLA). PostgreSQL RLS is **not** proposed by default (see §22 — `REQUIRES APPROVAL` if introduced).

### 4.6 Multi-tenant considerations

**Not a multi-tenant SaaS.** The platform is a single JAD instance; programs (Domestic/Abroad, BR-PRG-001) are **separate business programs within one database**, not tenants. Program separation is modeled via a `program_id` discriminator (proposal) rather than separate schemas/databases. Tenant-isolation patterns are therefore **not applicable**; object-level ownership (member ↔ own records) is enforced per NFR-AUTHZ-002.

### 4.7 Supabase implementation (Phase 1 — F0 → Postgres)

- **Implementation of PostgreSQL SSOT:** `Supabase Postgres 15+` is the **managed implementation** of the `PostgreSQL` engine above (hosted). `DATABASE_URL` from `Supabase` Dashboard → `supabase/migrations/*` (`supabase/migrations/20260829000001_auth_foundation.sql` for auth). Prisma has been removed (no `prisma/schema.prisma`).
- **Env:** `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (public, `VITE_`, `loadPublicEnv`) + server-only `DATABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (never `VITE_`, `.env` only). Documented in `apps/web/.env.example` + `apps/admin/.env.example`.
- **Auth:** `Supabase Auth` (`email/password` for `admin@jad.local` / `user@jad.local` — passwords from `SUPABASE_SEED_*` env) replaces `MockSessionProvider` `localStorage jad:mock:session` (cross-origin `5173` vs `5174` bug). `RLS` `members` `auth.uid() = id` `vouchers memberId = auth.uid()` `SUPER_ADMIN` bypass `service_role`. Fresh-start Phase 1 roles: `admin` / `user` via `MemberRole`. Phase 5 staff separation: internal staff live in `StaffUser` + `StaffAssignment` (keyed by auth id, `Role.domain='staff'`); `Member`/`MemberRole` are member-only, and member clients never read `Role`. Actor columns (`AuditLog.actor_id` dropped FK; `Registration.reviewedBy`, `Member.archivedBy`, `SystemConfig`/`cms_contents.updated_by` → `StaffUser` SET NULL). Phase 5 staff separation: internal staff live in `StaffUser` + `StaffAssignment` (keyed by auth id, `Role.domain='staff'`); `Member`/`MemberRole` are member-only, and member clients never read `Role`.
- **Storage:** bucket `marketing-tools` (public read, `SUPER_ADMIN` write) for `ContentItem` `IMAGE/VIDEO/PDF` `downloadUrl` (replaces `unsplash/gtv/w3` samples + `storage.objects` signed URLs, `admin/content` upload).
- **Realtime + pg_cron:** `Realtime` channel `notifications:memberId=eq.*` for `NotificationsPage` `useBroadcasts`; `pg_cron` for `voucher expiresAt`.

## 5. Data Modeling Principles

| # | Principle | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Normalize first** (3NF baseline); introduce only *justified* denormalization (§14). | CONFIRMED approach |
| 2 | **Surrogate keys** for all tables; natural/business unique keys enforced by unique constraints (§10, §13). | PROPOSED |
| 3 | **Money is `NUMERIC`** everywhere; never floating point; scale consistent (proposal `NUMERIC(18,2)` for amounts, `NUMERIC(5,4)` for rates). | PROPOSED (BR-WAL-002) |
| 4 | **Immutable financial records:** commission, ledger, adjustments, audit, redemption rows are insert-only; corrections are new transactions (BR-LED-002, BI-005). | CONFIRMED |
| 5 | **Snapshot values at transaction time** (property value on sale — BI-006; rate/base on commission — BR-COM-007 "changes apply to future only"). | CONFIRMED |
| 6 | **Status via explicit state columns + immutable audit trail**, not destructive row changes. | PROPOSED |
| 7 | **Derived values are derived, not duplicated** where feasible (available balance from ledger, §14.2). | PROPOSED |
| 8 | **Timestamps are `timestamptz`** (UTC storage, presentation-aware). | PROPOSED |
| 9 | **No real secrets/PII in seeds** (§19). | CONFIRMED |
| 10 | **Backward-compatible schema evolution:** additive migrations preferred; destructive migrations `REQUIRES APPROVAL` (§18). | CONFIRMED |
| 11 | **Traceability:** every table maps to confirmed requirements/rules/features (§23). No table exists for unconfirmed functionality. | CONFIRMED |

---

## 6. Entity Model

The confirmed entities are drawn from the confirmed business model (ROADMAP §5.3, FEAT-001). Status column: `CONFIRMED` = the entity is explicitly confirmed by requirements/rules; `PROPOSED` = the entity/table is the proposed implementation vehicle for a confirmed requirement.

### 9.2 Polymorphic reference

`ledger_entries.source_type` + `source_id` is a **soft polymorphic link** (to `commissions`/`withdrawals`/`financial_adjustments`/`vouchers`). Because PostgreSQL cannot enforce a single FK across multiple tables, integrity is enforced by: (1) application single-writer rule (ARCHITECTURE §6), (2) `source_type` CHECK enumeration, (3) audit + reconciliation queries. **REQUIRES APPROVAL** if strict referential integrity is mandated for these references (would require per-type nullable FK columns or a mapping table).

---

## 10. Keys

### 10.1 Primary keys

- All tables use surrogate `uuid` PK `id` (default `gen_random_uuid()`). Exception: `countries` uses natural `code` PK.
- Rationale: stable identities (FEAT-001), no enumeration exposure, no sequential guessing (API-SPECIFICATION §8). **PROPOSED**.

### 10.2 Natural vs surrogate

- Surrogate PKs everywhere; natural business identifiers enforced by unique constraints (§13):
  - `accounts.email` (case-insensitive)
  - `members.referral_code` (immutable, BR-REF-004)
  - `vouchers.code`
  - `programs.code`
  - `config_parameters.param_key`
  - `gender_values.code`
  - `countries.code`

### 10.3 Composite / functional keys

| Key | Columns | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `uq_member_balance` | `member_balances.member_id` | 1:1 validated balance |
| `uq_sale_commission_type` | `commissions(sale_id, commission_type)` **partial** (see §13) | ≤1 Direct Commission + ≤1 Direct Referral per sale (BR-COM-003) |
| `uq_redemption_idem` | `voucher_redemptions(voucher_id, idempotency_key)` | Atomicity (BI-007) |
| `uq_idempotency` | `idempotency_keys(account_id, key_hash)` | Replay prevention (API-SPECIFICATION §5.3) |
| `uq_primary_payout` | `payout_accounts(member_id)` WHERE `is_primary` | One primary per member (BR-PAY-006) |

### 10.4 Key-generation strategy

- UUID v4 via `gen_random_uuid()` (PgCrypto built-in) — **PROPOSED**.
- Referral codes: auto-generated unique alphanumeric code (FEAT-019); generated in application, uniqueness enforced by DB constraint (BR-REF-004).
- API-facing string IDs shown in API examples (e.g., `sal_001`, `wdr_001`) are **presentation-level opaque identifiers**; mapping from UUID to these is an API concern (**REQUIRES APPROVAL** if sequential public IDs are required — they are not required by any SSOT).

| I-19 | `ix_redemptions_voucher` | `voucher_redemptions(voucher_id, redeemed_at DESC)` | B-tree (composite) | Redemption history (BR-VCH-003) + verification (history check) | FR-VCH-003/005 |

> **Performance trade-offs:** each index adds write cost + storage. Indexes I-11 and I-08 are the largest (ledger grows append-only; sales queue). Ledger partitioning is NOT proposed now (NFR-SCAL-001 TBD) — revisit only when volume demands (§20).

## 12. Constraints

### 12.1 NOT NULL

- All PKs, all FK columns, and every column documented as `NO` in §7 are `NOT NULL`.
- Reasonable nullable per §7 (e.g., `middle_initial`, optional profile photo, verification timestamps).

### 12.2 CHECK constraints (DB-enforced invariants)

| # | Constraint | Table | Condition | Invariant |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| C-01 | `chk_member_balance_ge_0` | `member_balances` | `available_balance >= 0` | **BI-001** |
| C-02 | `chk_pending_ge_0` | `member_balances` | `pending_amount >= 0` | BI-002 |
| C-03 | `chk_property_value_gt_0` | `properties` | `value > 0` | Catalog integrity |
| C-04 | `chk_sale_snapshot_gt_0` | `sales` | `property_value_snapshot > 0` | BI-006 |
| C-05 | `chk_commission_amount_gt_0` | `commissions` | `amount > 0` | Financial integrity |
| C-06 | `chk_commission_rate` | `commissions` | `rate >= 0 AND rate <= 1` | Rate sanity (8%/4% baselines) |
| C-07 | `chk_ledger_amount_gt_0` | `ledger_entries` | `amount > 0` | Direction carries sign |
| C-08 | `chk_withdrawal_amount_gt_0` | `withdrawals` | `amount > 0` | — |
| C-09 | `chk_adjustment_amount_gt_0` | `financial_adjustments` | `amount > 0` | — |
| C-10 | `chk_voucher_value_gt_0` | `vouchers` | `value > 0` | BR-VCH-001 |
| C-11 | `chk_voucher_remaining_ge_0` | `vouchers` | `remaining_value >= 0` | BR-VCH-002 |
| C-12 | `chk_redemption_amount_gt_0` | `voucher_redemptions` | `redeemed_amount > 0` | — |
| C-13 | `chk_remaining_after_ge_0` | `voucher_redemptions` | `remaining_value_after >= 0` | BR-VCH-002 |

> Withdrawal amount ≤ Available Balance (BR-WDR-001), debit ≤ balance (BI-001), redemption ≤ remaining value are enforced **transactionally** (row locks + serializable, §20) because they depend on derived state (`member_balances` / `vouchers.remaining_value`), not on static CHECK constraints.

### 12.3 Foreign-key constraints

- All FKs listed in §9.1. **Delete behavior = `RESTRICT` on every FK.** No `CASCADE` exists or is permitted: financial/biographical history must never be cascade-deleted (BI-005, §16).

### 12.4 Unique constraints

- See §13.

### 12.5 Domain / state constraints (status enums)

Status columns are `text` + CHECK IN (…) (or native enums), mirrored in `packages/contracts`:

| Column | Allowed values | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `accounts.role` | `MEMBER, ADMIN, FINANCE, SUPER_ADMIN, MERCHANT` | BUSINESS-RULES §3 |
| `accounts.status` | `ACTIVE, DISABLED` (proposal) | — |
| `members.status` | `PENDING, APPROVED_ACTIVE, REJECTED` | BR-AUTH-002 |
| `sales.status` | `SUBMITTED, ADMIN_APPROVED, PAYMENT_VERIFIED, QUALIFYING_SALE, REJECTED, LOCKED` | BUSINESS-RULES §5, SCR-ADM-008 |
| `commissions.status` | `PENDING, AVAILABLE, CANCELLED, REVERSED` | BUSINESS-RULES §5 |
| `payout_accounts.status` | `PENDING, ADMIN_REVIEW, CONFIRMED` | BR-PAY-004 |
| `withdrawals.status` | `REQUESTED, RESERVED, COMPLETED, REJECTED` (final model **TBD** OD-017/018) | BR-WDR §5 |
| `vouchers.status` | `ACTIVE, REDEEMED` (+ `EXPIRED`, `REVOKED` **gated OD-020/021**) | BR-VCH; FEAT-058 BLOCKED |
| `ledger_entries.entry_type` | 9 types per FR-WAL-002 | FR-WAL-002 |
| `commissions.commission_type` | `DIRECT_COMMISSION, DIRECT_REFERRAL, GROUP_INCENTIVE` (latter gated OD-006..012) | FR-COM-013 |
| `geolocation_checks.method` | `GPS, IP` | BR-GEO-001/002 |

> **Do not add statuses not listed** (BUSINESS-RULES §5 warning; BR-WDR-006, BR-VCH-007, OD-017/018/019..023).

### 12.6 Database-enforced invariants summary

| Invariant | Enforcement |
|---|---|
| BI-001 Available Balance ≥ 0 | CHECK C-01 on `member_balances` + transactional single-writer |
| BI-002 Pending never available | CHECK C-02 + ledger semantics (pending excluded from available derivation) |
| BI-003 Direct Referral only to direct sponsor | Application rule + `commissions.beneficiary_member_id` written from `members.sponsor_id` at qualification; single-level (no recursive computation) |
| BI-004 No MLM entitlement | No schema supports multi-level; genealogy is read-only reporting |
| BI-005 Financial records immutable | Role grants REVOKE UPDATE/DELETE on financial tables (§22) + RESTRICT FKs |
| BI-006 Historical value preserved | Snapshot columns (`sales.property_value_snapshot`, `commissions.base_value`) |
| BI-007 Atomic redemption | UNIQUE `(voucher_id, idempotency_key)` + row lock + serializable + CHECK remaining |
| BI-008 Signing key never accessible to DB | Key never stored; only payload + signature in `vouchers` |
| BI-009 Referral persistent/immutable | `members.referral_code` UNIQUE + no update path; `sponsor_id` change only via audited Admin workflow |
| BI-010 No auto-refund | No refund/chargeback tables exist |

---

## 13. Uniqueness Rules

| # | Scope | Columns | NULL behavior | Case sensitivity | Business driver |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| U-01 | `accounts.email` | UNIQUE on `citext` | Non-null; no NULL duplicates concern | **Case-insensitive** (citext) | Login identity (FR-AUTH-001) |
| U-02 | `members.account_id` | UNIQUE | Non-null | — | 1:1 account→member |
| U-03 | `members.referral_code` | UNIQUE | Non-null | Case-sensitive generated code; generated to avoid ambiguity | BR-REF-004 (unique, immutable) |
| U-04 | `members(id)` self FK sponsor | not unique (1:N) | `sponsor_id` NULL allowed (no sponsor, BR-REG-008) | — | Single-level referral |
| U-05 | `commissions(sale_id, commission_type)` | UNIQUE **partial** — `WHERE commission_type IN ('DIRECT_COMMISSION','DIRECT_REFERRAL')` | Non-null | — | ≤1 of each per sale (BR-COM-003) |
| U-06 | `voucher_redemptions(voucher_id, idempotency_key)` | UNIQUE | Non-null | Key hashed | Atomicity (BI-007) |
| U-07 | `payout_accounts(member_id)` WHERE `is_primary` | UNIQUE partial | — | — | One primary per member (BR-PAY-006) |
| U-08 | `idempotency_keys(account_id, key_hash)` | UNIQUE | Non-null | Hash | Replay prevention (API-SPEC §5.3) |
| U-09 | `vouchers.code` | UNIQUE | Non-null | Case-sensitive (QR) | Redemption lookup (FR-VCH-005) |
| U-10 | `programs.code` | UNIQUE | Non-null | — | Program separation (BR-PRG-001) |
| U-11 | `config_parameters.param_key` | UNIQUE | Non-null | — | Single source per parameter (BR-CFG-001) |
| U-12 | `gender_values.code` | UNIQUE | Non-null | — | Configurable gender set (BR-REG-011) |
| U-13 | `program_config(program_id, param_key)` | UNIQUE | Non-null | — | Independent per-program config (BR-PRG-002) |

> **Duplicate-prevention notes:** email uniqueness is case-insensitive (citext). Referral codes are generated (collision retried in application, uniqueness enforced at DB). No other business-scoped uniqueness exists in the confirmed rules; none are invented.

---

## 14. Normalization

### 14.1 Approach

- **3NF baseline.** Single logical rows for entities; multi-valued facts normalized into child tables (e.g., qualification answers, payout accounts, redemptions, ledger entries, audit entries).
- FKs (`RESTRICT`) provide referential integrity; no duplicated master data (customer not duplicated per sale; property value not duplicated except the justified snapshot).

### 14.2 Intentional denormalization (each justified)

| # | Denormalization | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| D-01 | `sales.property_value_snapshot` | **BI-006** — historical value must not change when catalog price changes (BR-PRP-004). Snapshot required, not a violation. |
| D-02 | `commissions.base_value` + `rate` snapshot | **BR-COM-007** — rate changes apply to future commissions only; historical commission must reflect value/rate at transaction time. |
| D-03 | `member_balances.available_balance` (validated cache) | Read efficiency for balance display/checks (SCR-MEM-001/012); **validated against the ledger** and updated in the same transaction (single writer). Not the source of truth — ledger is. |
| D-04 | `members.age` | Derived from DOB for efficient eligibility enforcement (BR-REG-001); recomputed on DOB/config change. |
| D-05 | `members.is_qualified` | Cached Active + Qualified eligibility flag (BR-REG-007, BR-QUAL-001) for fast sale/sponsor checks; maintained transactionally at approval/qualification events. |
| D-06 | `sales.resubmission_count` | Cached counter to enforce configurable max (BR-SAL-006); derived from rejection history, maintained in the sale state transition. |
| D-07 | `vouchers.remaining_value` | Needed for redemption verification/display (BR-VCH-002); updated atomically with redemptions. |
| D-08 | `qualification_answers.question_text_snapshot` | Preserves meaning of past answers when question text changes (data-modeling principle 5). |
| D-09 | `ledger_entries.source_type/source_id` | Enables traceability from ledger to origin without separate join tables; integrity by single-writer + audit (see §9.2). |

> Every denormalization is deliberate and traceable; none duplicates mutable master data in a way that can drift silently.

### 14.3 Derived-flag maintenance (no drift)

- `members.age`: recomputed from DOB at registration and when min-age config changes (FEAT-013).
- `members.is_qualified`: recomputed on email verification, ID verification, Admin approval, and qualification completion (BR-REG-007, BR-QUAL-001, FEAT-023).
- `member_balances`: recomputed only through the eWallet single-writer services inside the same transaction as ledger posts (ARCHITECTURE §6).

---

## 15. Audit Strategy

### 15.1 Standard audit fields

- `created_at` on **all** tables (UTC, `now()`).
- `updated_at` on **mutable** tables only (trigger-managed — `PROPOSED`; Drizzle raw SQL `SET updated_at = now()` alternative).
- Actor columns: `created_by_account_id` / `verified_by_account_id` / `decided_by_account_id` / `performed_by_account_id` / `issued_by_account_id` / `updated_by_account_id` where a human action is recorded.

### 15.2 Immutable audit trail (`audit_log`)

- Every audited mutation writes one `audit_log` row **in the same transaction** as the mutation (no partial audit).
- Audited actions (FEAT-004): registration approval/rejection (BR-REG-004), ID verification (BR-REG-002), sale approval/rejection (BR-SAL-005), payment verification (BR-SAL-003), geolocation override (BR-GEO-004), sponsor assignment/change (BR-REF-006/007), locked-sale reopening (BR-SAL-007), financial adjustments (BR-ADJ-002), withdrawal actions (BR-WDR-004), voucher issuance (SCR-ADM-017).
- `audit_log` is **insert-only**; UPDATE/DELETE revoked from all roles (FEAT-004 "cannot be edited or deleted").
- Retention: kept indefinitely per NFR-AUD-001 (no retention policy documented; **REQUIRES APPROVAL** if any archival/purge policy is later required).

### 15.3 History-vs-audit split

- State **history for review screens** (rejection reasons, transition timeline) is served from `audit_log` (single immutable trail) — no duplicated per-entity history tables (§7 notes). Exceptions where a dedicated snapshot is justified: `qualification_answers.question_text_snapshot`, sale/commission financial snapshots (§14).

---

## 16. Soft Deletion

- **No general soft-delete (`deleted_at`) column is introduced.** The confirmed business model uses **explicit statuses**, not soft deletion (BUSINESS-RULES §5): members use `status` (PENDING/APPROVED_ACTIVE/REJECTED), properties use `is_active`, policies use DRAFT/PUBLISHED/ARCHIVED, payout accounts use lifecycle statuses.
- **Hard-delete rules:**
  - **Financial/audit tables are never deleted, hard or soft** (`ledger_entries`, `commissions`, `financial_adjustments`, `voucher_redemptions`, `audit_log`) — BI-005, NFR-AUD-001.
  - **Referenced/biographical tables are never hard-deleted** (`accounts`, `members`, `customers`, `properties`, `sales`, `withdrawals`, `payout_accounts`, `vouchers`) — history and referential integrity (RESTRICT FKs) require retention. Deactivation uses status flags.
  - **Operational content** (`media_assets`, `policies`, `broadcasts`) may be deactivated via status; hard delete **REQUIRES APPROVAL** and is discouraged.
  - **Owner-approved exception (2026-09-09):** `DELETE /admin/members/:id` (super_admin only) permanently purges one member and their entire owned graph via the `member_purge_cascade` SECURITY DEFINER function (single transaction, mandatory reason, `MEMBER_PURGED` audit, auth-user removal). This is the sole member hard-delete path; archive remains the default lifecycle.
- **Query implications:** read queries filter by status/`is_active`; no `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL` pattern needed.
- **Restoration:** status-based (e.g., reactivate property, re-open locked sale via audited Admin review, BR-SAL-007). No soft-delete restoration flow exists.
- `sponsor_change_requests` and `email_verifications` expire/close via status, not deletion.

---

## 17. Data Lifecycle

| Stage | Rules |
|---|---|
| **Creation** | All rows created via module repositories only (FOLDER-STRUCTURE §2.2). Audit-worthy creations write `audit_log` in the same transaction (§15). |
| **Read / access** | Object-level authorization: member reads only own records (NFR-AUTHZ-002); staff reads scoped by role (BUSINESS-RULES §3); staff dashboards query queues by status (§11 indexes). |
| **Updates** | Mutable tables updated in place (`updated_at` bumped). Financial/audit tables **never updated** (BI-005). Status transitions are updates of the state column + audit entry in one transaction. |
| **State transitions** | See BUSINESS-RULES §5 (member, sale, commission, payout, withdrawal). Only confirmed states; TBD states not added (BR-WDR-006, OD-017/018). |
| **Archiving** | None defined in requirements; **REQUIRES APPROVAL** if ledger/content archival is ever required (none proposed now). |
| **Soft deletion** | Not used (§16). |
| **Hard deletion** | Prohibited for financial/audit/biographical/transactional tables; operational content deletion REQUIRES APPROVAL (§16). |
| **Retention** | Audit and financial records retained indefinitely (NFR-AUD-001). General retention policy for PII **REQUIRES APPROVAL** (NFR-DATA-001 compliance — no retention period documented). |
| **Historical records** | Snapshot columns preserve transaction-time facts (BI-006); append-only ledger preserves financial history (BI-005). |
| **Cascading behavior** | None — all FKs RESTRICT. No cascade delete exists (BI-005). |

---

## 18. Migration Strategy

| Item | Choice | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Tooling | Drizzle Kit / versioned SQL migrations in-repo (`apps/api/src/database/migrations/`) | **PROPOSED** (TECH-STACK §5/§6, BACKEND-ARCHITECTURE §5.2) |
| Versioning | Sequential numbered migration files (`0001_...sql`, `0002_...sql`) applied in order | PROPOSED |
| Ordering | Strict forward order; migration runs under the `migration`/`ddl` role (§22), never the app role | PROPOSED |
| Backward compatibility | Additive-only by default: new tables, nullable new columns, new CHECK/unique — never break running code before deployment completes | PROPOSED |
| Data migrations | SQL `UPDATE`/`INSERT` migrations separate from DDL where possible; idempotent (safe to re-run) | PROPOSED |
| Rollback | Forward + rollback scripts per migration where feasible; Drizzle up/down pattern | PROPOSED |
| Production safety | Migrations run in deploy pipeline with pre/post validation; destructive operations gated | PROPOSED |
| Destructive policy | **Dropping tables/columns, irreversible transforms, major relationship changes REQUIRE APPROVAL** (§24; BACKEND-ARCHITECTURE §5.2) | CONFIRMED boundary |

> Migrations never target financial tables destructively: append-only tables may only gain columns (additive); dropping or altering financial columns is `REQUIRES APPROVAL`.

---

## 19. Seed Strategy

| Seed | Environment | Content | Rules |
|---|---|---|---|
| Reference data | All | `countries` (ISO 3166), `programs` (Domestic/Abroad), `gender_values` (Male/Female/LGBT defaults), default `config_parameters` (min age 18, rates 8%/4%, clearing 7 days, resubmission limit, redemption mode), `qualification_questions` bank (content per program **TBD** OD-002) | Idempotent (upsert by natural key); no code changes required for config (NFR-MAINT-001) |
| Dev seed | Local dev / test | Synthetic members, customers, properties, sales, commissions, ledger, withdrawals, vouchers for UI/API dev | No real PII; clearly fake data; **never real secrets** |
| Test seed | Test/CI | Purpose-built fixtures per acceptance criteria (AC-REG-001, AC-COM-001, AC-WAL-001, AC-WDR-001, AC-VCH-001, AC-ADJ-001, AC-SAL-001) | Created by tests, not shipped; database disposable |
| Production seed | Production | Reference/config data **only** | No synthetic business rows; no real PII; **REQUIRES APPROVAL** for any production data seeding beyond reference data |
| Sensitive handling | — | Password hashes for dev accounts only (random, non-real); payout account identifiers are placeholders; ID documents are placeholder media | §22 protection applies to seeds too |

> **Never include real secrets, real PII, or production data in seeds.** Production admin/staff accounts are provisioned operationally (secret manager), not seeded.

---

## 20. Performance Considerations

| Concern | Design | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Query patterns | Confirmed patterns only (registration, login, admin queues, member ledger/wallet, redemption) drive indexes (§11) | PROPOSED |
| Indexing strategy | Indexes justified per pattern; composite indexes for queue+ordering; UNIQUE for identity/lookup | PROPOSED |
| Large-table considerations | `ledger_entries` is append-only and grows forever; supported by (member_id, created_at DESC) for cursor pagination (I-11). **No partitioning now** — revisit when NFR-SCAL-001 targets are set (**REQUIRES APPROVAL** to add) | PROPOSED |
| Pagination | **Cursor pagination** (API-SPECIFICATION §4) — no OFFSET on large tables; cursors use `(created_at, id)` | PROPOSED |
| Filtering / sorting | Allowlisted sort keys only (API-SPEC §4); supported by indexes above | PROPOSED |
| Joins | Repositories may join **within their own module's tables**; cross-module reads use contracts (FOLDER-STRUCTURE §2.2). No cross-module repository joins | CONFIRMED |
| Aggregations | Balance derivation = ledger aggregation; cached in `member_balances` within the same transaction | PROPOSED |
| N+1 risks | Repositories use batch queries (e.g., member lists, commission lists) with explicit joins/`IN`; ORM (Drizzle) typed queries for reads | PROPOSED |
| Connection considerations | Managed PostgreSQL + connection pool (application tier); pool sizing at deployment (**REQUIRES APPROVAL** — NFR-PERF-001 TBD) | PROPOSED |
| Expected growth | Unknown — NFR-SCAL-001 is TBD; no premature optimization, sharding, or partitioning | CONFIRMED |
| Caching considerations | **Database caching (Redis/read replicas) is NOT required** (BACKEND-ARCHITECTURE §14); financial truth is never cached outside the transactional boundary. Any cache REQUIRES APPROVAL | CONFIRMED |
| Write-hot paths | Commission creation, redemption, withdrawals → controlled by transaction isolation + row locks, not by scaling shards (ARCHITECTURE §14) | CONFIRMED |

> **Avoid premature optimization** (principle in §5): no read replicas, no partitioning, no materialized views until performance targets (NFR-PERF-001, NFR-SCAL-001) are approved.

---

## 21. Backup & Recovery

| Item | Choice | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Backup strategy | Managed PostgreSQL backups (continuous WAL archiving + periodic full backups) — provider-dependent | **PROPOSED / REQUIRES APPROVAL** (ARCH-DEC-008 provider OPEN) |
| RPO | **TBD — REQUIRES APPROVAL** (ARCH-DEC-009; not defined anywhere) | REQUIRES APPROVAL |
| RTO | **TBD — REQUIRES APPROVAL** | REQUIRES APPROVAL |
| Point-in-time recovery (PITR) | Enabled on managed PostgreSQL (WAL) | PROPOSED |
| Restore strategy | Restore to staging first for validation; verified restore drills before/periodically | PROPOSED |
| Disaster recovery | Multi-AZ/region strategy **REQUIRES APPROVAL** (provider/region OPEN, ARCH-DEC-008) | REQUIRES APPROVAL |
| Data-loss risks | Financial/audit tables are irreplaceable — backup policy must prioritize them; RESTRICT FKs mean no cascade recovery needed | CONFIRMED |
| Environment considerations | Dev/test databases are disposable; production backups per approved policy; **no real data copied into dev/test without approval** | CONFIRMED |

> No RPO/RTO values are invented; they remain `REQUIRES APPROVAL` until ARCH-DEC-009 / NFR-AVAIL-001 / NFR-REL-001 targets are approved.

---

## 22. Security Considerations

Security-by-design is mandatory; critical decisions are not invented (API-SPECIFICATION §8, BACKEND-ARCHITECTURE §17, NFR-SEC-001/002).

| Concern | Control | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Authentication boundary | App authenticates via session cookies (HttpOnly/Secure/SameSite — ARCH-DEC-007); credentials verified against `accounts`; password hashes only | CONFIRMED |
| Authorization model | RBAC per BUSINESS-RULES §3 (roles on `accounts.role`); object-level ownership checks on every member-scoped read (NFR-AUTHZ-002); DB roles mirror app roles | CONFIRMED |
| Row-level security (RLS) | **Not proposed** — single-tenant; object-level authorization in the application layer. If RLS is later required, it is **REQUIRES APPROVAL** (security-policy change) | PROPOSED (not used) |
| Least privilege | Dedicated DB roles: `app` (DML scoped to module tables), `migration`/`ddl` (schema changes), `reporting` (read-only), `audit` (append-only writer). No role holds blanket DDL/DML | CONFIRMED approach |
| App vs privileged/service roles | `app` role never runs DDL; destructive DDL only by `migration` role in deploy pipeline (§18); DBAs do not have plaintext access to SECRET columns (§8.3) | PROPOSED |
| BI-005 enforcement | **REVOKE UPDATE, DELETE** on `ledger_entries`, `commissions`, `financial_adjustments`, `voucher_redemptions`, `audit_log` (and write-only grants) | CONFIRMED (BI-005) → mechanism PROPOSED |
| Sensitive data protection | PII encrypted at rest (managed provider); `account_identifier` field-level encryption **REQUIRES APPROVAL**; passwords/tokens hashed; redaction in logs (API-SPEC §8) | PROPOSED |
| Tenant isolation | Not applicable (single-tenant; programs are not tenants — §4.6) | — |
| Database exposure | Private network only; no public DB access; TLS in transit | CONFIRMED approach |
| Injection protection | Parameterized queries only; repositories never concatenate SQL (API-SPEC §8, BACKEND-ARCHITECTURE §5) | CONFIRMED |
| Audit requirements | `audit_log` insert-only, same-transaction writes, actor/target/date/reason/result (FEAT-004) | CONFIRMED |
| Signing boundary | Master signing key **never** in DB or accessible to DBAs (BR-SEC-002, BI-008); DB stores only signed payload + signature | CONFIRMED |
| Secrets | Secrets via environment/secret manager; never in seeds (§19); `.env*` ignored | CONFIRMED |

## 25. Risks and Assumptions

| # | Risk / Assumption | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| A-01 | **ASSUMPTION:** single currency (PHP) — no multi-currency requirement documented | Money schema fixed at `numeric(18,2)` | Verify with Owner (DA-11); additive if changed |
| A-02 | **RISK:** no RPO/RTO/performance/scalability targets defined (ARCH-DEC-009, NFR-* ) | Backup/DR + indexing may be over/under-provisioned | Do not invent targets; gate via DA-02/DA-03 |
| A-03 | **RISK:** polyglot `ledger_entries.source_type/source_id` lacks FK enforcement | Referential drift possible | Single-writer rule + audit + reconciliation (DA-10) |
| A-04 | **ASSUMPTION:** customer "Property / Property Value" (BR-CUS-002) is captured at sale time via snapshot (API-SPEC §7.1) | Customer table has no property/value columns | Documented reconciliation; flag for Owner if customer-scoped property is intended |
| A-05 | **RISK:** `member_balances` cache could drift from ledger | Balance errors | Same-transaction updates + reconciliation jobs; ledger remains source of truth |
| A-06 | **ASSUMPTION:** status enums (PENDING/APPROVED_ACTIVE/etc.) are exhaustive per BUSINESS-RULES §5 | Additional states would be schema changes | Gated: no new states without approval (BR-WDR-006, OD-017/018, OD-019..023) |
| A-07 | **RISK:** financial-table immutability depends on role grants that must be verified in the chosen hosting | Weakest point for BI-005 | Explicit migration-time grant checks; tested in CI |
| A-08 | **ASSUMPTION:** object storage (media/ID docs) is external; DB holds metadata only | Primary DB stays lean; no blob handling | Adapters per BACKEND-ARCHITECTURE §2.1 |
| A-09 | **RISK:** version numbers for PostgreSQL/Drizzle are `REQUIRES VERIFICATION` (no manifests exist) | Schema DDL syntax may differ | Confirm versions at implementation (TECH-STACK §9) |
| A-10 | **ASSUMPTION:** single primary database; no read replicas/partitions now | Scale handled later | Revisit when NFR-SCAL-001 approved (DA-03) |

## 26. Acceptance Criteria

This document is accepted as the **Database SSOT** when:

1. **AC-01** — `docs/database/DATABASE-DESIGN.md` exists and contains all sections 1–26.
2. **AC-02** — Database technology is the approved PostgreSQL (ARCH-DEC-003) with Drizzle + raw-SQL ledger writes (ARCH-DEC-004); no invented tech.
3. **AC-03** — Every entity/table maps to confirmed requirements/business rules/features (§23); no tables for unapproved functionality (no MLM, no payment gateway, no auto-refund).
4. **AC-04** — All financial invariants (BI-001..BI-010) are enforced at the database layer or explicitly flagged (§12.6); money is `NUMERIC` (BR-WAL-002).
5. **AC-05** — Keys, indexes, constraints, and uniqueness rules are documented and justified by confirmed query patterns (§10–§13); no unjustified indexes.
6. **AC-06** — Lifecycle, soft-deletion (none), audit strategy, and hard-delete rules are documented and consistent with BUSINESS-RULES §5 and FEAT-004 (§15–§17).
7. **AC-07** — Migration, seed, performance, backup/recovery, and security considerations are documented; destructive/irreversible decisions are `REQUIRES APPROVAL` (§18–§22).
8. **AC-08** — No business rule, rate, status, or behavior is silently invented; all `TBD`/`REQUIRES APPROVAL` items are explicitly flagged (§24–§25).
9. **AC-09** — The document is internally consistent and consistent with all existing SSOTs; contradictions are documented, not silently resolved (§25).
10. **AC-10** — The document is ready to serve as the authoritative Database SSOT for implementation (Drizzle schema, migrations, seeds).
