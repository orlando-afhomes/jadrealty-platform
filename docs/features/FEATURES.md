# JAD — Feature & Implementation Inventory

> **Authority:** This document is the **authoritative feature and implementation inventory** for the JA&D (JAD) system.
>
> **Governance:** Features are derived from `../requirements/REQUIREMENTS.md` (requirements SSOT) and `../business/BUSINESS-RULES.md` (business rules SSOT). If a feature conflicts with either source, the requirements/business-rules SSOT prevails; record the conflict and mark **REQUIRES OWNER APPROVAL**. Do not invent requirements or business rules.
>
> **Planning authority:** Implementation sequencing, phases, milestones, and MVP scope are defined in `ROADMAP.md`.
>
> **Version:** Project 01 — Feature & Implementation Planning (Baseline v1.0)

## 6. Gaps & Open Items

### 6.1 Features Blocked on Owner Decisions

| Feature | Blocking decision(s) |
|---|---|
| FEAT-017 | OD-014 (geolocation accuracy threshold) |
| FEAT-018 | OD-015 (anti-GPS-spoofing) |
| FEAT-022 | OD-013 (sponsor-change circumstances; workflow itself is confirmed) |
| FEAT-041 | OD-006..012 (Group Incentive parameters) — status DEFERRED |
| FEAT-047 | OD-016 (final payout providers) |
| FEAT-051 | OD-017, OD-018 (withdrawal status model / workflow) |
| FEAT-058 | OD-019..023 (voucher transfer/revoke/expiry/merchant permissions) |
| FEAT-066 | OD-025 (Total Earned definition) |
| FEAT-069 | OD-001..005 (Domestic/Abroad rule differences) |

### 6.2 Requirements with No Active Feature
- **FR-REG-006** (max registration attempts) — explicitly FUTURE scope (OD-024). No feature until approved. Recorded intentionally.

### 6.3 Traceability Status
- All CONFIRMED functional requirements mapped to at least one feature. **No orphaned confirmed requirements.**
- NFR numerical targets (NFR-AVAIL-001, NFR-REL-001, NFR-PERF-001, NFR-SCAL-001) are TBD and apply to FEAT-001.
- Business-rule coverage is complete (see §5.3).

### 6.4 Assumptions Applied
- ASSUMPTION 1 (authentication as platform capability) → FEAT-002.
- ASSUMPTION 2 (email service external) → FEAT-006.
- ASSUMPTION 3 (geolocation services external) → FEAT-014.
- ASSUMPTION 4 (customers have no self-service access) → FEAT-024.
- ASSUMPTION 5 (payout providers external) → FEAT-047.
- ASSUMPTION 6 (push notification infrastructure external) → FEAT-063.
- ASSUMPTION 7 (CTO signing service external to app infrastructure) → FEAT-052, FEAT-059.
- Voucher issuance is a necessary consequence of confirmed signing/redemption requirements; issuance workflow specifics are an assumption (see FEAT-052).
