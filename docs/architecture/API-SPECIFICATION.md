# JAD — API Specification SSOT (API-SPECIFICATION.md)

> **Authority:** Defines the REST API architecture, conventions, and endpoint inventory for the JA&D platform. Companion to `ARCHITECTURE.md` (modular Vercel Functions, backend handlers) and `TECH-STACK.md` (Vercel Functions, OpenAPI 3.1) as updated Q1 2026-08-30.
>
> **Status of endpoints:** The repository contains **no implementation**. Every endpoint below is **PLANNED** unless marked otherwise. No endpoint is invented without a feature/requirement justification (§6 traceability). Endpoints #84–#89 (§6.16) are **PROPOSED** additions from the Project 09 audit, closing evidence-backed gaps; they require approval before implementation.
>
> **Status vocabulary:** **CONFIRMED** (established requirement) · **PROPOSED** (recommended, not approved) · **REQUIRES APPROVAL** (material decision).
>
> **Version:** Project 09 — API & Integration Engineering (Audited Baseline v1.1). This version is the companion API contract to `INTEGRATION-SPECIFICATION.md`; integration concerns (external systems, reliability, webhooks/events, security) are owned there.

## 1. API Conventions

### 1.1 Style
- REST over HTTPS, JSON (`application/json`).
- Base path: `/api/v1`.
- Resource naming: kebab-case plural nouns (`/payout-accounts`).
- Actions expressed as HTTP verbs; sub-resource verbs only when no noun fits (e.g., `/sales/:id/verify-payment`).
- Collection endpoints return `{ data, meta }`; single-resource endpoints return the resource object directly; errors always use the error envelope (§5).

### 1.2 HTTP Semantics & Status Codes

| Method | Meaning | Codes |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | Read (no side effects) | 200 |
| `POST` | Create / submit / action (state change) | 201 (create), 200 (action) |
| `PATCH` | Partial update of mutable (non-financial) fields | 200 |
| `PUT` | Not used by default (avoided for partial semantics) | — |
| `DELETE` | Prohibited on financial records; allowed only on reversible, approved resources | 204 |

| Code | Use |
|---|---|
| 200 | Success (GET/actions) |
| 201 | Resource created |
| 204 | No content (delete/void) |
| 400 | Malformed request / validation error |
| 401 | Unauthenticated |
| 403 | Authenticated but not authorized (role/eligibility/ownership) |
| 404 | Not found (never leak existence of others' resources) |
| 409 | Conflict (business state, e.g., sale LOCKED, insufficient balance) |
| 422 | Business-rule violation (e.g., member not Active + Qualified) |
| 429 | Rate limited |
| 500 | Server error (generic; no internals leaked) |

**Important:** Business-eligibility failures return 403 (role/eligibility) or 422 (business rule) — never 401.

### 1.3 Validation
- All request bodies validated against Zod schemas in `packages/contracts` (single source).
- Validation happens in the presentation layer before any business logic.
- Rejection of sales, members, and withdrawals requires a **mandatory reason** (BR-REG-004, BR-SAL-005, BR-WDR-004) — enforced at the API level.
- Money/rates are exact decimals (`NUMERIC`); floats are rejected.

---

## 2. Authentication & Authorization

### 2.1 Authentication (Q1/Q3)
- **Supabase Auth JWT** (PKCE, `Authorization: Bearer` or Supabase cookie) verified server-side per Q3 — supersedes `HttpOnly` session (ARCH-DEC-007 archived). `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword` in `supabase.ts:50-65` with `cookieStorage` cross-port `5173↔5174`.
- No new `HttpOnly` DB session for v1; `POST /auth/verify-email` remains the gate before approval (BR-AUTH-001).
- Internal/service-to-service calls use `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (bypasses RLS) — never user JWT for seed.

### 2.2 Authorization
- **RBAC (Vercel middleware + RLS)** enforces BUSINESS-RULES.md §3 for every endpoint.
- **Object-level authorization (NFR-AUTHZ-002):** member-scoped endpoints verify the session user owns the resource (prevents IDOR/BOLA). Staff roles use staff-scoped paths; no staff role can act on a member's behalf through member endpoints.
- **Business eligibility is separate from roles:** e.g., `POST /sales` requires role Member **and** status Active + Qualified (BR-SAL-001). Returns 422 `MEMBER_NOT_QUALIFIED` otherwise.
- Role shorthand used below: `PUBLIC`, `AUTH` (any authenticated principal — member or staff), `MEM` (any authenticated member), `AQ` (Active + Qualified), `ADM` (Admin), `FIN` (Finance), `SUP` (Super Admin), `MRCH` (Merchant), `SYS` (internal service identity).
- `SYS` is an **internal service identity**, not a database account role (the `accounts.role` CHECK holds `MEMBER, ADMIN, FINANCE, SUPER_ADMIN, MERCHANT`). Internal/service-to-service calls use a short-lived token from the secret manager, never user cookies.

## 3. Error Format

All errors use one envelope:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "SALE_LOCKED",
    "message": "Sale has reached the maximum resubmission attempts and is locked.",
    "details": { "maxAttempts": 3 },
    "requestId": "a1b2c3",
    "timestamp": "2026-08-18T10:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

### Error codes (initial, non-exhaustive)

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `VALIDATION_ERROR` | Input failed Zod schema |
| `UNAUTHORIZED` | No/invalid session |
| `FORBIDDEN` | Role/eligibility/ownership violation |
| `NOT_FOUND` | Resource not found (404) |
| `CONFLICT` | State conflict (409) |
| `RATE_LIMITED` | 429 |
| `MEMBER_NOT_QUALIFIED` | Action requires Active + Qualified (422) |
| `SALE_LOCKED` | Sale locked after max attempts (409) |
| `REJECTION_REASON_REQUIRED` | Mandatory reason missing (422) |
| `INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE` | Withdrawal exceeds Available Balance (409) |
| `RESERVATION_CONFLICT` | Reservation race (409) |
| `VOUCHER_INVALID_SIGNATURE` | Signature verification failed (403) |
| `VOUCHER_INVALID` | Not authentic / wrong status (403) |
| `VOUCHER_EXPIRED` | Expired (403) |
| `VOUCHER_ALREADY_REDEEMED` | Double redemption attempt (409) |
| `VOUCHER_INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE` | Redeem amount > remaining (409) |
| `PAYOUT_ACCOUNT_UNVERIFIED` | Unverified account selected (422) |
| `INTERNAL` | Unhandled server error (500) |

---

## 4. Pagination, Filtering, Sorting

| Area | Convention |
|---|---|
| Admin lists | Page-based: `?page=1&pageSize=50` (default 50, max 100) |
| Ledger / financial streams | Cursor-based: `?cursor=<opaque>&limit=50` — stable order (id asc) |
| Sorting | `?sort=field&order=asc\|desc`; **allowlisted per endpoint** (never arbitrary column names) |
| Filtering | `?status=...`, `?q=...`; allowlisted keys per endpoint |
| Meta | List responses: `{ "data": [...], "meta": { "pagination": {...} } }` |
| Response size | Never return ledger/commission history unbounded |

---

## 5. Versioning, Rate Limiting, Idempotency

### 5.1 Versioning
- URI prefix `/api/v1`. Breaking changes create `/api/v2`; deprecated endpoints are announced per phase. PROPOSED.

### 5.2 Rate Limiting
- Per-IP and per-user limits.
- Strict limits: `POST /auth/login`, `/auth/register`, `/auth/verify-email`, `POST /vouchers/:id/redemptions`.
- Limits are configurable (BR-CFG-001). Exact values TBD (REQUIRES APPROVAL).

### 5.3 Idempotency
- `Idempotency-Key` header (UUID) **required** on: `POST /sales`, `POST /me/withdrawals`, `POST /vouchers/:id/redemptions`, `POST /financial-adjustments`.
- Server stores key → response; retries return the stored response without re-applying side effects (prevents double redemption / double reservation — BI-007, BR-WDR-002).
- Key TTL proposed: 24h (REQUIRES APPROVAL).

### 5.4 OpenAPI / Swagger
- OpenAPI 3.1 authored from `packages/contracts` Zod schemas + handler routes; published at `/api/v1/docs`.
- `packages/contracts` Zod schemas generate TS types consumed by frontends.
- Every endpoint documented with auth, request schema, response schema, and error codes.

## 8. API Security (Security-by-Design)

| Concern | Control |
|---|---|
| Authentication | HttpOnly/Secure/SameSite cookies; CSRF protection for cookie-authenticated requests; refresh rotation |
| Authorization | RBAC guards (BUSINESS-RULES §3) + object-level ownership checks on every member-scoped resource (NFR-AUTHZ-002) |
| Least privilege | No staff endpoint exposes more than the role needs; DB roles mirror app roles |
| Input validation | Zod schemas on all requests; strict money/rate formats |
| Injection | Parameterized queries only; repositories never concatenate SQL |
| Sensitive data | No PII/financial data in logs or error responses; 500s are generic; profiles/IDs are redacted where not needed |
| IDOR/BOLA | Ownership verification by resource owner id vs. session principal; 404 hides others' resources |
| CORS | Allowlist of first-party origins only |
| Secrets | All secrets via environment/secret manager; never committed; `.env*` ignored |
| Rate limiting | Per-IP/per-user; strict on auth and redemption (§5.2) |
| Auditability | Every mutation on approvals/verifications/exceptions/adjustments writes to `audit` (NFR-SEC-002) |
| Failure behavior | Atomic transactions; idempotency for retries; partial application impossible on financial paths |
| Signing boundary | Application can only **verify** signatures (public key); master key exists only in the CTO-controlled service (BI-008) |

| §6.15 Config | FEAT-005 | FR-ADM-001 |
| §6.16 Additional (PROPOSED) | FEAT-004, FEAT-007, FEAT-010, FEAT-012, FEAT-032, FEAT-048..050, FEAT-060 | FR-REG-002/003/010, FR-MEM-001, FR-ADM-002, FR-SAL-007, FR-WDR-001..005, NFR-AUD-001, NFR-SEC-002 (no new requirements) |

**No endpoint is invented for unapproved functionality.** Gated endpoints (#21, #42, #76, #80 and any OD-gated detail) must not be implemented until the corresponding Owner decision is approved (OD-001..025). Endpoints #84–#89 (§6.16) are PROPOSED additions that close evidence-backed gaps; they must be approved before implementation.
