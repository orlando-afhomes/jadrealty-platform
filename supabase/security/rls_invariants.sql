-- RLS invariant audit (Phase 3B) — run read-only in the SQL editor / CI after
-- every migration batch. Each query must return ZERO rows (empty = PASS).
--
-- Triage: any returned row is either a real finding (fix the policy/grant it
-- names, not this file) or a deliberately granted exception — document
-- exceptions inline below with owner + date instead of deleting the check.
--
-- NOTE: pg_policies.roles is name[], so the literal must be cast (42883
-- otherwise). `public` is included everywhere: PUBLIC-role grants bypass
-- anon/authenticated scoping and the original queries missed them.

-- 1) No write policy reachable by untrusted roles (was: 42883 type error).
select schemaname, tablename, policyname, cmd, roles
from pg_policies
where roles && array['anon', 'authenticated', 'public']::name[]

-- (member + staff identities; Phase 1 staff domain).

where grantee in ('anon', 'authenticated', 'PUBLIC')
  and table_name in ('Member', 'MemberRole', 'Role', 'StaffUser', 'StaffAssignment')

-- 3) No table-level write privilege for untrusted roles anywhere
-- (all writes are service-role-only by design).

from pg_policies
where schemaname = 'storage'
  and tablename = 'objects'
  and roles && array['anon', 'authenticated', 'public']::name[]
  and cmd in ('INSERT', 'UPDATE', 'DELETE', 'ALL');

-- 5) No public-schema routine executable by untrusted roles without review.
-- Money functions (withdraw_reserve, withdrawal_complete, withdrawal_reject,
-- sale_qualify, …) must be service_role-only; any row naming one is a FAIL.
-- Other rows are triage candidates, not automatic failures.

-- enabled but no policies is deny-by-default, which is safe and passes).
