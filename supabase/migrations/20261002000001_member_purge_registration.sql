-- Phase D follow-up — purge releases the member's application rows.
--
-- Owner-approved (purge-everything): a purged email must be reusable for a
-- fresh re-registration. "Registration" carries a unique index on email (B8)
-- and has no member FK (email-keyed), so ON DELETE CASCADE never touches it
-- and the base purge left the stale application behind. POST /auth/register
-- then replays that non-PENDING row as 409 "already exists" forever, and the
-- surviving auth identity stays login-capable. This revision deletes the
-- member's own application rows (email match, lowercased on both sides —
-- registration intake stores emails lowercased) as part of the same single
-- transaction, and reports the count in the returned snapshot for audit.
-- Application rows of OTHER emails are untouched.
--
-- Validation (must hold after apply):
--   select prosrc like '%"Registration"%' from pg_proc where proname = 'member_purge_cascade';
--   select grantee from information_schema.role_routine_grants
--     where routine_name = 'member_purge_cascade'; -- only service_role
--   -- behavior: purging a member with a Registration row removes it, so the
--   -- email unique index no longer blocks a fresh POST /auth/register.
-- Idempotent (create or replace + revoke/grant are idempotent).
-- Down (rollback only):
--   drop function if exists public.member_purge_cascade(uuid, uuid, text);
--   re-apply 20261001000001_member_purge.sql to restore the prior version.
