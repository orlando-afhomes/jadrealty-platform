-- Phase D — Super-admin permanent member purge (owner-approved exception).
--
-- Sanctioned default lifecycle remains ARCHIVE (POST /admin/members/:id/archive).
-- This function is the sole hard-delete path, super_admin-only at the API
-- layer (verifyStaff SUPER_ADMIN_ONLY). It deletes the member and their
-- ENTIRE graph in ONE transaction so a partial purge can never happen:
-- ledger, commissions, withdrawals, sales, customers, wallets, payout
-- accounts, owned vouchers/adjustments, member roles, notifications, and the
-- Member row itself. The API then deletes the auth.users row and writes a
-- MEMBER_PURGED audit entry (audit of the purge survives; only the member's
-- own history is destroyed — the authorized BI-005 exception).
--
-- Semantics:
--   - Financial records owned by the member are DELETED here (ledger/commissions/
--     withdrawals/wallets). Corrections-as-new-transactions (BR-LED-002) do not
--     apply because the entire financial identity is being destroyed.
--   - FKs stay enforced the whole time: dependent rows are deleted leaf-first
--     so ON DELETE RESTRICT never fires.
--   - Sponsor links to OTHER members are severed via SET NULL (sponsorId),
--     preserving the remaining members' accounts.
--   - SET-NULL attributions on kept tables (Registration.reviewedBy,
--     SystemConfig.updated_by, cms_contents.updated_by, archivedBy) null out.
--   - Adjustment rows owned by the member are deleted (BI-005 exception noted);
--     adjustments authored by other members are left untouched.
--
-- Validation (must hold after apply):
--   select prosrc is not null from pg_proc where proname = 'member_purge_cascade';
--   select grantee from information_schema.role_routine_grants
--     where routine_name = 'member_purge_cascade'; -- only service_role
-- Idempotent (create or replace + revoke/grant are idempotent).
-- Down (rollback only):
--   drop function if exists public.member_purge_cascade(uuid, uuid, text);
