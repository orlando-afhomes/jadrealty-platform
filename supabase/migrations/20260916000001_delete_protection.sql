-- Phase 1B — Financial deletion protection (Database review F-04).
--
-- Member.id references auth.users ON DELETE CASCADE, and the financial / CRM
-- tables below cascade to Member. Combined with the admin "Delete member
-- permanently" flow, one delete wiped Wallet, LedgerEntry, Commission,
-- MemberPayoutAccount, Sale, and Customer history — violating BR-LED / BI-005
-- (immutable ledger; deactivate, never delete).
--
-- Fix: money/CRM links become ON DELETE RESTRICT so a member with any
-- financial or sales history cannot be hard-deleted (archive is the only
-- sanctioned lifecycle). Nullable membership links already use SET NULL and
-- are left unchanged. AuditLog.actor_id stays NO ACTION (it already blocks
-- deletion of anyone who performed audited actions).
-- Idempotent per constraint (dropped then re-added with an explicit name).
-- Down: re-add each as the original cascade FK.
