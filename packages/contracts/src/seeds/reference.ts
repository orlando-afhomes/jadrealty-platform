      'Members who are Active and Qualified may record qualifying sales against catalog properties through the platform. Each sale must include a verified customer record and a valid property selection. Sales are reviewed by JA&D Admin and may be approved, rejected, or locked after repeated resubmissions. Only sales that reach payment verification are considered qualifying.\n\n' +

      'Members may refer new members using their personal referral code. Referral relationships are strictly single-level (direct referrer only) and are used for reporting purposes such as Direct Referrals, Group Network, and Genealogy views. Referral relationships never imply multi-level commission entitlement.\n\n' +

      'Members must meet the qualification checklist, including email verification, ID verification, and admin approval. Members are expected to follow the program guidelines, handle customer information responsibly, and use marketing materials only as provided through the official content library.',
